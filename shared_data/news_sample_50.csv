According to a paper published Wednesda,0.5,1,"Researchers from China have spotted a black hole that is so massive and so ancient that it contradicts our current understanding of how these bodies are formed. According to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the black hole is 12 billion times the mass of the Sun and was formed in the very infancy of our universe -- less than 900 million years after the Big Bang.

Black holes, which are regions of space-time that are so dense that not even light can escape their gravitational pull, are formed when a massive star collapses under its own weight. As these objects consume nearby dust and stars, or merge with other black holes, they grow in size. Because the process of swallowing interstellar matter takes time, it makes the discovery of such a massive, ancient black hole a challenge to the current theories of the evolution of such bodies.

""How do you build such a big black hole in such a short time?,"" Xue-Bing Wu of Peking University in Beijing, who is the lead author of the study, asked, according to a report by the National Geographic magazine.

The black hole, which became visible due to the presence of superheated gas jets and a rapidly spinning accretion disk, was spotted using the Lijiang Telescope in Yunnan, China. Studying the light from the quasar, which was found to be 40,000 times as bright as the entire Milky Way, scientists calculated that the black hole was formed about 12.9 billion years ago, when the universe was just 6 percent of its current age.

""It (the black hole) must have been accreting gas at close to the maximum rate for most of its existence,"" Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, who was not involved in the study, reportedly said. Another possible explanation is that the black hole might have begun its life not with the collapse of a single star, but with the collapse of a very large gas cloud.

However, both explanations directly contradict theories about how black holes formed and grew in the early universe.

""We are still very uncertain as to the modes of black-hole formation and growth in the early Universe ... so we do not have a leading model for this observation to pose problems to,"" Chris Willott, an astronomer at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre in Victoria, reportedly said.",2,0.5,0,0.0,"Gigantic, Ancient Black Hole 12 Billion Times The Mass Of Sun Puzzles Scientists","Researchers from China have spotted a black hole that is so massive and so ancient that it contradicts our current understanding of how these bodies are formed.

An off-label drug prescribed to treat osteoarthritis of the hand when conventional medication has failed is ineffective, according to new research.

The study shows there was no benefit in taking hydroxychloroquine to control debilitating pain when compared to a placebo (dummy substance).

The first-line treatment for hand osteoarthritis - paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids - is often not effective and some patients experience adverse reactions. Doctors have used hydroxychloroquine as an off-label alternative.

Prescription drugs are licensed for certain conditions: off-label use means doctors are using them to treat illnesses outside of that designated or authorised list.

It is not clear how often doctors use hydroxychloroquine off-label although it is believed to be a common practice.

Lead researcher Dr Sarah Kingsbury, from the University of Leeds and NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre at Chapel Allerton Hospital, said: ""There is some scientific basis as to why hydroxychloroquine could be an effective drug agent.

""It is known to target inflammation in the joints and is a recognised and licensed treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.

""There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a factor in osteoarthritis. So doctors have used hydroxychloroquine off-label, in a way that it was not licensed for, to try and control symptoms and pain.

""But until now, there has not been a large-scale study into whether using hydroxychloroquine works. And our evidence shows that for most patients it is not an effective treatment.""

The study is published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

Osteoarthritis of the hand is a painful and disabling condition which tends to affect people as they get older. It can stop people from carrying out everyday activities - and can limit their quality of life.

The research study, funded by Arthritis Research UK, estimated that up to 31 per cent of people aged over 70 suffer from the condition.

The study involved 248 patients at 13 NHS hospitals in England: all had the condition for at least 5 years and had changes to the joints in their hands consistent with osteoarthritis.

The participants all reported moderate to severe pain on at least half of the days in the previous three months to the study commencing.

The study found that patients initially reported a small reduction in the severity of pain before the improvement plateaued. However, that change was seen in both the group receiving the medication and the group taking the placebo.

Measurements of grip strength and the structural damage existing in patients' joints were similar for both groups.

Dr Kingsbury said: ""Our findings do not support the current medical practice of giving hydroxychloroquine to patients with hand osteoarthritis.""

Figures from Arthritis Research UK show that 8.75 million people over the age of 45 have sought treatment for all types of osteoarthritis. One third have to stop working or reduce their working hours because of the pain of the condition.

According to the charity, hand osteoarthritis is more commonly seen in people whose occupations required increased manual dexterity.

Dr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: ""While this drug is known to be effective for some forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, this study does not back up its use for hand osteoarthritis.

Hand osteoarthritis can have a huge impact on a person's life, limiting their ability to live independently and carry out everyday tasks such as dress, wash and cook for themselves.

""It is vital that we invest in research to improve the treatment options available to people with this condition. Anyone concerned about the effectiveness of their treatment should seek advice from their doctor.""

Xiao Hong hat roten Lippenstift dick aufgetragen und ist ganz in Schwarz gekleidet. Ihre Stiefel reichen bis uber ihre Knie. Um den Hals baumelt eine Goldkette. Beim Treffen an einer im Suden Pekings gelegenen U-Bahn-Station nickt sie dem Gast zu, lachelt und sagt: <<Wir treffen uns hier, weil du meine Unterkunft nicht finden wurdest.>> Nach einem funfzehnminutigen Fussmarsch ist das Wohnquartier erreicht, wo die Frau in den Dreissigern lebt. Sie nutzt jedoch nicht den Aufzug, um nach oben zu fahren, sondern steigt in Pekings Untergrund. Dort spenden Neonrohren nur schummriges Licht.

Ohne die Hilfe Xiaos wurde man sich in dem Labyrinth ohne Tageslicht verirren. Schliesslich ist sie am Ziel und sperrt die Tur zu ihrem rund sechs Quadratmeter grossen Zimmer auf.

Ein Uberbleibsel von Mao Zedong

Der Raum ist karg eingerichtet. Neben einem Bett gibt es einen Schrank, der fast auseinanderfallt. Auf dem Boden steht ein Reiskocher, einige leere Wasserflaschen liegen herum. Zwei grosse Teddybaren verleihen der Raumlichkeit etwas Personliches. Xiao sind die Bedingungen egal. <<Ich zahle insgesamt 900 Yuan (127 Franken) pro Monat. Mehr will ich nicht ausgeben>>, betont sie. Die aus Xi'an, der Hauptstadt der Provinz Shaanxi, stammende Frau lebt seit mehr als acht Jahren in Peking.

Wie viele Chinesen in Pekings Untergrund hausen, ist unbekannt. In den Spitzenzeiten sollen es rund eine Million gewesen sein. Den Behorden sind die Behausungen schon lange ein Dorn im Auge. Durch den letzten Schlag gegen die Wanderarbeiter im November und Dezember 2017, als die Pekinger Regierung sie aus der Metropole trieb, durfte die Zahl der Bewohner im Untergrund weiter gesunken sein.

Das unterirdische System ist ein Uberbleibsel aus der Zeit des Grunders der Volksrepublik China, Mao Zedong. Der paranoide Tyrann hatte aus Angst vor einer Invasion der verhassten Sowjetunion den Befehl erteilt, in allen Neubauten in den chinesischen Stadten ein Keller- und Luftschutzbunker-System zu errichten. Nach dem Tode Maos 1976 ordnete der Pragmatiker Deng Xiaoping die Kommerzialisierung des Untergrunds an. Einen Teil der unterirdischen Raumlichkeiten haben private Wohnungsbaugesellschaften erworben. Und das Zivilverteidigungsburo hat die Flachen an Pekinger vermietet, die wiederum die Zimmer an Wanderarbeiter weitervermietet haben.

Fur diese sind die dunklen, heruntergekommenen und klammen Raumlichkeiten die einzige Chance, um in der Hauptstadt finanziell uber die Runden zu kommen. Die Unterkunfte befinden sich in der Nahe ihrer Arbeitsstellen, wodurch sie die Fahrkosten fur die offentlichen Verkehrsmittel sparen. Die Wanderarbeiter sind im informellen Sektor tatig oder uben illegale Berufe aus, haben ungeregelte Arbeitszeiten und verdienen wenig. Da sie uber kein Hukou - einen Eintrag im Haushaltsregistrierungssystem - fur Peking verfugen, haben sie kein Anrecht auf staatlich subventionierte Wohnungen in der Hauptstadt. Sie mussen eine Unterkunft auf dem freien Mietwohnungsmarkt suchen. Und dort ist der Mietzins in den vergangenen Jahren explodiert. Bezahlbarer Wohnraum ist fur Chinesen mit geringem Einkommen rar.

Die im Untergrund lebenden Wanderarbeiter werden in China auch als <<Rattenstamm>> bezeichnet. Es handelt sich um einen doppeldeutigen Neologismus: Wie Ratten stromen sie taglich aus ihren unterirdischen Lochern, um all die Tatigkeiten auszuuben, fur die sich viele Pekinger zu fein sind. Die im Untergrund lebenden Wanderarbeiter und jene, die in den oberen Stockwerken bei Tageslicht deutlich bessere Lebensbedingungen geniessen, trennen denn auch Welten, obwohl sie im selben Gebaude wohnen. Das Gefalle zwischen Arm und Reich ist in China gross und durfte eines Tages fur die Kommunistische Partei zu einem Problem werden.

Lukrative Einnahmen fur Prostituierte

Xiao ficht die soziale Schieflage nicht an. Fur sie bieten die Jahre in Peking die Gelegenheit, Geld zu verdienen, um eines Tages in die Heimat zuruckzukehren und sich mit dem Ersparten eine neue Existenz aufzubauen. Sie lebt nicht nur im Dunkeln, sie muss auch im Verborgenen arbeiten, weil ihr Beruf in China verboten ist. Xiao ist Prostituierte. Aus Zufall schlug sie diesen Weg ein. <<Eine Freundin konnte sich immer einen teuren Lebensstil leisten. Ich wurde neugierig und fragte, woher sie das Geld hat>>, sagt sie ruckblickend. Ihre Freundin arbeitete als Prostituierte und vermittelte Xiao den ersten Kunden. Er habe sie zum Abendessen eingeladen und sei hoflich gewesen, bevor sie sich miteinander vergnugt hatten.

Seitdem bietet sie im Suden Pekings ihre Dienstleistungen in einem als Massagesalon getarnten Etablissement an. Davon gibt es in Peking unzahlige - einige sind serios, andere dagegen zwielichtig. Es kommt vor, dass die Dame am Empfang dem Kunden mit einer eindeutigen Handbewegung erklart, dass dieses Angebot besonders gut fur Manner sei, und zweideutig grinst.

Angst vor der Polizei, die immer wieder Razzien gegen das Gewerbe durchfuhrt, hat sie nicht. Xiao hat zwei Vorkehrungen getroffen, um die Polizisten zu tauschen. Der Betreiber des Massagesalons warnt die Damen, sobald die Sicherheitskrafte vorbeischauen. Und die Kunden durfen sich nicht ausziehen. Sie lassen die Hosen runter und streifen das Kondom uber. Falls die Polizei anruckt, muss alles ganz schnell gehen. Das unromantische <<Liebesspiel>> dauert nicht einmal zehn Minuten. Xiao verdient dafur zwischen 300 und 400 Yuan pro Kunde. Von solchen Gehaltern konnen die Frauen in anderen Branchen nur traumen. Am Tag hat Xiao zwischen drei und vier Kunden. Das reiche ihr, fugt sie an. Wie begehrt ihre Dienstleistungen sind, zeigen die vielen Anrufe. Immer wieder klingelt das Smartphone. Den Respekt vor den Mannern hat Xiao nicht verloren, auch wenn ihr Betrunkene manchmal Arger bereiten. <<Die besuchen mich, um ihre Bedurfnisse zu befriedigen>>, betont sie.

Da es den Sicherheitskraften oft nicht gelingt, die Paare in flagranti zu erwischen, sind sie auf Beweismaterial angewiesen. Die Polizei sucht bei Verdachtigen fieberhaft nach Kondomen, die sie als Beleg fur bezahlten Sex werten. Xiaos Handtasche ist voll davon. Sie ist schlagfertig und kann sich damit herausreden, dass sie als Freiwillige in einem Programm arbeitet und die Prostituierten mit Kondomen versorgt. In Polizeigewahrsam ist sie noch nie geraten. Entdecken die Sicherheitskrafte bei den Mannern das noch ubergestulpte Kondom, hat Xiao ebenfalls eine Ausrede parat. Er habe sich selbst befriedigt, erzahlt sie den Polizisten. Manche Ordnungshuter drucken auch ein Auge zu, wenn sie fur ihr Schweigen bezahlt werden.

Sexuelle Krankheiten breiten sich aus

Wie die Zahlen zur Entwicklung der HIV-Infizierten in China zeigen, ist der Bedarf an Verhutung und Schutz vor sexuellen Krankheiten gross. Laut der Nationalen Gesundheitskommission hat es im Juni vergangenen Jahres in ganz China 820 000 an Aids Erkrankte gegeben; gegenuber dem Vorjahreszeitraum entsprach dies einem Zuwachs von 14 Prozent. <<Viele Frauen, die neu in dem Geschaft sind, tun sich schwer und sind zu schwach, die Kunden von der Nutzung eines Kondoms zu uberzeugen>>, sagt Xiao. Deshalb verteilt sie die kostenlosen Praservative an ihre Kolleginnen und scharft ihnen ein, auf der Nutzung zu bestehen. Viele Kunden lehnen den Schutz jedoch ab und setzen sich sowie die Sexarbeiterinnen grossen Gefahren aus. Xiao selbst schlaft nur mit den Freiern, wenn sie willens sind, Kondome zu nutzen.

Es gehort zur Eigenart des chinesischen Systems, dass der Staat die Ausgabe von Kondomen und auch Bluttests fur die Prostituierten finanziert, obwohl das Gewerbe verboten ist. Fliegen die Sexarbeiterin und der Kunde auf, drohen der Frau eine 15-tagige Gefangnisstrafe sowie eine Busse von bis zu 5000 Yuan. Daruber hinaus besteht fur die Prostituierte und den Freier die Gefahr, dass sie fur bis zu zwei Jahre in einem Erziehungslager verschwinden. Die Menschenrechtsorganisation Human Rights Watch hat deren Abschaffung schon diverse Male gefordert - bisher ohne Erfolg. Die Regierung hat sich noch nicht dazu durchringen konnen, das steinzeitlich anmutende Gesetz zu beerdigen.

Xiao lehnt trotz der Gefahr, von der Polizei verhaftet zu werden, eine Legalisierung der Prostitution ab. <<Bereits heute ist der Konkurrenzkampf um die Kunden hart, weil viele Frauen versuchen, mit Sex schnelles und gutes Geld zu verdienen>>, sagt sie. <<Wenn die Politik das Gewerbe legalisiert, kommen noch mehr auf die Idee, ihre Korper zu verkaufen.>> Eine zu starke Konkurrenzsituation ist jedoch nicht im Interesses Xiaos und ihrer Kolleginnen.

So far electrical cables are used only to transmit electricity. However, nanotechnology scientist and professor Jayan Thomas and his Ph.D. student Zenan Yu have developed a way to both transmit and store electricity in a single lightweight copper wire.

Their work is the focus of the cover story of the June 30 issue of the material science journal Advanced Materials and Nature has published a discussion about this technology in the current issue.

""It's an interesting idea,"" Thomas said. ""When we did it and started talking about it, everyone we talked to said, ""Hmm, never thought of that. It's unique.'""

Copper wire is the starting point but eventually, Thomas said, as the technology improves, special fibers could also be developed with nanostructures to conduct and store energy.

More immediate applications could be seen in the design and development of electrical vehicles, space-launch vehicles and portable electronic devices. By being able to store and conduct energy on the same wire, heavy, space-consuming batteries could become a thing of the past. It is possible to further miniaturize the electronic devices or the space that has been previously used for batteries could be used for other purposes. In the case of launch vehicles, that could potentially lighten the load, making launches less costly, Thomas said.

Thomas and his team began with a single copper wire. Then they grew a layer of nanowhiskers on the outer surface of the copper wire. These whiskers were then treated with a special alloy, which created an electrode. Two electrodes are needed for the powerful energy storage. So they had to figure out a way to create a second electrode.

They did it- this by adding a very thin plastic sheet around the whiskers and wrapping it around using a metal sheath (the second electrode) after generating nanowhiskers on it (the second electrode and outer covering). The layers were then glued together with a special gel. Because the nanowhisker layer is insulating, the inner copper wire retains its ability to channel electricity, the layers around the wire independently store powerful energy.

In other words, Thomas and his team created a supercapacitor on the outside of the copper wire. Supercapcitors store powerful energy, like that needed to start a vehicle or heavy-construction equipment.

Although more work needs to be done, Thomas said the technique should be transferable to other types of materials. That could lead to specially treated clothing fibers being able to hold enough power for big tasks. For example, if flexible solar cells and these fibers were used in tandem to make a jacket, it could be used independently to power electronic gadgets and other devices.

""It's very exciting,"" Thomas said. ""We take it step by step. I love getting to the lab everyday, and seeing what we can come up with next. Sometimes things don't work out, but even those failures teach us a lot of things.""

Yu is the co-author of the study. He works in Thomas' Nano Energy-Photonics Group.

Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Scientists have developed a heat-deflecting film that could reject up to 70 percent of the sun's heat from a window.

Researchers published the results of tests with the film in a study published Thursday in the journal Joule.

The film resembles transparent plastic wrap, implanted with tiny microparticles that contain water that releases when met with temperatures higher than 85 degrees Fahrenheit. After squeezing out the water, the microparticles contract into tight clusters of fiber that repel light.

""It's like a fishnet in water,"" Nicholas Fang, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, said in a press release. ""Each of those fibers making the net, by themselves, reflects a certain amount of light. But because there's a lot of water embedded in the fishnet, each fiber is harder to see. But once you squeeze the water out, the fibers become visible.""

About a year ago, Fang began research with scientists at the University of Hong Kong who were eager to develop technology to ward off heat from the inside of buildings during the city's well-known hot summers.

The technology has its financial benefits as well. Air conditioning cost roughly $29 billion to use annually, accounting for 6 percent of all electricity use in the United States. To cut those costs and the inefficiency that come along with heavy air conditioning use, the researchers set out to create technology to protect office buildings from the nasty summer heat in Hong Kong and the U.S.

""Meeting this challenge is critical for a metropolitan area like Hong Kong, where they are under a strict deadline for energy savings,"" Fang said, in reference to Hong Kong's aim to reduce energy use by 40 percent by the year 2025.

Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Scientists have developed a heat-deflecting film that could reject up to 70 percent of the sun's heat from a window.

Researchers published the results of tests with the film in a study published Thursday in the journal Joule.

The film resembles transparent plastic wrap, implanted with tiny microparticles that contain water that releases when met with temperatures higher than 85 degrees Fahrenheit. After squeezing out the water, the microparticles contract into tight clusters of fiber that repel light.

""It's like a fishnet in water,"" Nicholas Fang, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, said in a press release. ""Each of those fibers making the net, by themselves, reflects a certain amount of light. But because there's a lot of water embedded in the fishnet, each fiber is harder to see. But once you squeeze the water out, the fibers become visible.""

About a year ago, Fang began research with scientists at the University of Hong Kong who were eager to develop technology to ward off heat from the inside of buildings during the city's well-known hot summers.

The technology has its financial benefits as well. Air conditioning cost roughly $29 billion to use annually, accounting for 6 percent of all electricity use in the United States. To cut those costs and the inefficiency that come along with heavy air conditioning use, the researchers set out to create technology to protect office buildings from the nasty summer heat in Hong Kong and the U.S.

""Meeting this challenge is critical for a metropolitan area like Hong Kong, where they are under a strict deadline for energy savings,"" Fang said, in reference to Hong Kong's aim to reduce energy use by 40 percent by the year 2025.

Although our wireless devices are generally seen as a convenience, they can also be a plague of everyday intrusions and interruptions to our most intimate relationships. According to a recent study published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media Culture, technology and screens that keep us constantly connected to the world actually create ""technoference"" and disconnects us from our significant others.

It's no surprise smartphones, tablets, and laptops can distract our attention from the present moment. A Mobile Mindset Study found we are constantly connected, with nearly 60 percent of people admitting they don't go an hour without checking their phone. This also extend to the bedroom with more than half admitting they check their phones while lying in bed before they go to sleep, after they wake up, and even in the middle of the night.

Using a smartphone isn't smart in bed. In a relationship, a couple's bed is a sacred place and ideal for going to sleep and waking up to reconnect not disconnect with a partner. The frequency of technoference in romantic relationships can interrupt interactions such as couple leisure time, conversations, and mealtimes with partners.

In an effort to examine the effects of electronic devices on intimate relationships, Sarah Coyne, an author of the study and a psychologist at Brigham Young University surveyed over 140 married or cohabiting heterosexual women and asked them about their phone, TV, computer and tablet habits. They were also asked about how their partner used technology, if there was any conflict about using technology, and about their satisfaction with their relationship and life overall.

The findings revealed the most common technoference was seeing a partner pick up his phone during couple leisure time with 62 percent of woman admitting this happened at least once a day. During a conversation, 40 percent of women said their men would get distracted by the TV at least once a day while a third said he would take out his phone in the middle of a conversation or during a meal together. A quarter of the participants reported their partner would actually send texts or emails to another person while they were having a face-to-face conversation with their significant other.

Overall, the more technoference in relationships, the more likely women reported conflict over technology use, lower relationship satisfaction, more depressive symptoms, and lower life satisfaction. Using a structural equation model of technoference predicting conflict over technology use, the researchers found it predicted relationship satisfaction, which finally predicted depression and life satisfaction. The partners of these women were giving their energy to digital distractions and not their partner, which could set the stage for infidelity.

The mere sight of a cellphone could also lead to trouble in paradise. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that people who engaged in personal discussions when a phone was nearby, even if the couple isn't using it, reported lower relationship quality and less trust for their partner. They believed their partner was less empathetic to their concerns.

Although smartphones allow us to connect with friends, co-workers, and even former flames leading to immediate feelings of intimacy and deeper connections, it can lessen our connection with our near and dear ones. Completely removing technology from the relationship to combat smartphone interruptus is not the answer, according to the authors of the study. Instead, they suggest for couples to make rules about technology.

""Just having the discussion about what's OK and what's not when it comes to devices at the dinner table or in the bedroom can help,"" Coyne said to National Public Radio. Coyne's own method is: ""Put [the phone] out of my reach, like on top of the refrigerator, just so that it releases the temptation.""

Couples should try to turn off their electronic devices in the bedroom to turn on.

Phot",0.25,1,"The quest to find new ways to harness solar power has taken a step forward after researchers successfully split water into hydrogen and oxygen by altering the photosynthetic machinery in plants.

Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy. Oxygen is produced as by-product of photosynthesis when the water absorbed by plants is 'split'. It is one of the most important reactions on the planet because it is the source of nearly all of the world's oxygen. Hydrogen which is produced when the water is split could potentially be a green and unlimited source of renewable energy.

A new study, led by academics at St John's College, University of Cambridge, used semi-artificial photosynthesis to explore new ways to produce and store solar energy. They used natural sunlight to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using a mixture of biological components and humanmade technologies.

The research could now be used to revolutionise the systems used for renewable energy production. A new paper, published in Nature Energy, outlines how academics at the Reisner Laboratory in Cambridge developed their platform to achieve unassisted solar-driven water-splitting.

Their method also managed to absorb more solar light than natural photosynthesis.

Katarzyna Sokol, first author and PhD student at St John's College, said: ""Natural photosynthesis is not efficient because it has evolved merely to survive so it makes the bare minimum amount of energy needed -- around 1-2 per cent of what it could potentially convert and store.""

Artificial photosynthesis has been around for decades but it has not yet been successfully used to create renewable energy because it relies on the use of catalysts, which are often expensive and toxic. This means it can't yet be used to scale up findings to an industrial level.

The Cambridge research is part of the emerging field of semi-artificial photosynthesis which aims to overcome the limitations of fully artificial photosynthesis by using enzymes to create the desired reaction.

Sokol and the team of researchers not only improved on the amount of energy produced and stored, they managed to reactivate a process in the algae that has been dormant for millennia.

She explained: ""Hydrogenase is an enzyme present in algae that is capable of reducing protons into hydrogen. During evolution this process has been deactivated because it wasn't necessary for survival but we successfully managed to bypass the inactivity to achieve the reaction we wanted -- splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.""

Sokol hopes the findings will enable new innovative model systems for solar energy conversion to be developed.

She added: ""It's exciting that we can selectively choose the processes we want, and achieve the reaction we want which is inaccessible in nature. This could be a great platform for developing solar technologies. The approach could be used to couple other reactions together to see what can be done, learn from these reactions and then build synthetic, more robust pieces of solar energy technology.""

This model is the first to successfully use hydrogenase and photosystem II to create semi-artificial photosynthesis driven purely by solar power.

Dr Erwin Reisner, Head of the Reisner Laboratory, a Fellow of St John's College, University of Cambridge, and one of the paper's authors described the research as a 'milestone'.

He explained: """"This work overcomes many difficult challenges associated with the integration of biological and organic components into inorganic materials for the assembly of semi-artificial devices and opens up a toolbox for developing future systems for solar energy conversion.""",4,0.3333333333333333,0,0.0,Scientists pioneer a new way to turn sunlight into fuel: New research in the field of semi-artificial photosynthesis -- ScienceDaily,"The quest to find new ways to harness solar power has taken a step forward after researchers successfully split water into hydrogen and oxygen by altering the photosynthetic machinery in plants.

A new Tel Aviv University study identifies a previously unknown mechanism involved in the ",0.16666666666666666,1,"This news or article is intended for readers with certain scientific or professional knowledge in the field.

A new Tel Aviv University study identifies a previously unknown mechanism involved in the development of Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The research focuses on a specific microRNA whose levels were found to decrease as a result of ALS-causing muscular mutations. The study highlights, for the first time, the importance of toxic muscle-secreting molecules in the pathology of ALS.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that destroys nerve cells and causes permanent disability. Currently there is no cure and ALS remains a devastating illness. The findings could serve as the foundation for the treatment of ALS in the future.

The study was led by Dr. Eran Perlson of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and conducted by TAU doctoral students Roy Maimon and Ariel Ionescu, in collaboration with Dr. Oded Behar of Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. It was recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

""While we are not claiming we have found the cure for ALS, we have certainly moved the field forward,"" Dr. Perlson said.

Solving a mystery

Researchers have been hard-pressed to understand the specific underlying mechanisms of ALS. Some have focused their efforts on the metabolism of microRNAs (miRs), small molecules that regulate the translation of proteins and play an important role in many other cellular processes.

Recent work has demonstrated that the alteration of miRs is involved in many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. The TAU study identifies a new mechanism related to ALS pathology, in which the muscle secretes toxic molecules that kill axons and neuromuscular junctions and by that leads to muscle atrophy. It also found reduced levels of one specific miR -- miR-126-5p -- in ALS models, which cause elevations in the toxic molecules, such as the axon-destabilizing type-3 Semaphorins and their co-receptor Neuropilins.

According to Dr. Perlson and his team, this new miR could one day be harnessed to treat ALS patients.

From microchips to mice

""We demonstrated in lab work and on mouse models that we can successfully ameliorate ALS symptoms using this miR as a potential drug,"" Dr. Perlson said. ""We further demonstrated that muscle tissue -- not only motor neurons -- are undoubtedly involved in the progression of ALS. This point is particularly important, as it contradicts other theories in the field.""

Dr. Perlson and his team worked on primary motor neuron and muscle tissue samples grown in silicon microchips to model the human motor unit. They discovered that genetic manipulation of the novel miRNA significantly slowed the neuron degeneration process.

The team subsequently harnessed transgenic ALS mouse models, injecting these with a virus carrying the novel miR126-5p, and found that the mice had recovered significantly. Muscle atrophy, neuromuscular function and ability to walk, all basic features of the disease, showed significant improvement.

A new Tel Aviv University study identifies a previously unknown mechanism involved in the development of Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The research focuses on a specific microRNA whose levels were found to decrease as a result of ALS-causing muscular mutations. The study highlights, for the first time, the importance of toxic muscle-secreting molecules in the pathology of ALS.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that destroys nerve cells and causes permanent disability. Currently there is no cure and ALS remains a devastating illness. The findings could serve as the foundation for the treatment of ALS in the future.

The study was led by Dr. Eran Perlson of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and conducted by TAU doctoral students Roy Maimon and Ariel Ionescu, in collaboration with Dr. Oded Behar of Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. It was recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

""While we are not claiming we have found the cure for ALS, we have certainly moved the field forward,"" Dr. Perlson said.

Solving a mystery

Researchers have been hard-pressed to understand the specific underlying mechanisms of ALS. Some have focused their efforts on the metabolism of microRNAs (miRs), small molecules that regulate the translation of proteins and play an important role in many other cellular processes.

Recent work has demonstrated that the alteration of miRs is involved in many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. The TAU study identifies a new mechanism related to ALS pathology, in which the muscle secretes toxic molecules that kill axons and neuromuscular junctions and by that leads to muscle atrophy. It also found reduced levels of one specific miR -- miR-126-5p -- in ALS models, which cause elevations in the toxic molecules, such as the axon-destabilizing type-3 Semaphorins and their co-receptor Neuropilins.

According to Dr. Perlson and his team, this new miR could one day be harnessed to treat ALS patients.

From microchips to mice

""We demonstrated in lab work and on mouse models that we can successfully ameliorate ALS symptoms using this miR as a potential drug,"" Dr. Perlson said. ""We further demonstrated that muscle tissue -- not only motor neurons -- are undoubtedly involved in the progression of ALS. This point is particularly important, as it contradicts other theories in the field.""

Dr. Perlson and his team worked on primary motor neuron and muscle tissue samples grown in silicon microchips to model the human motor unit. They discovered that genetic manipulation of the novel miRNA significantly slowed the neuron degeneration process.

The team subsequently harnessed transgenic ALS mouse models, injecting these with a virus carrying the novel miR126-5p, and found that the mice had recovered significantly. Muscle atrophy, neuromuscular function and ability to walk, all basic features of the disease, showed significant improvement.

""We found that the specific overexpression of miR126-5p was beneficial for both axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in vivo in ALS mice models,"" Dr. Perlson said. ""We were able to pinpoint the fact that alterations in miR126-5p facilitate motor neuron degeneration.""

Would you skip school? Eat pig's feet? Deliberately get arrested? How about forgo having kids?

For 33-year-old British musician Blythe Pepino the latter is a reality. Her fears about climate change are so strong she has decided not to have biological children.

""I really want a kid,"" she told CNN. ""I love my partner and I want a family with him but I don't feel like this is a time that you can do that.""

Pepino believes that there will be an ""ecological Armageddon"" and founded BirthStrike at the end of 2018. BirthStrike is a group of people who are declaring their decision not to have kids because of climate change.

So far, over 330 people have joined, of which Pepino estimates 80% are women.

'Inheriting a world worse than ours'

The BirthStrikers have decided they can't bring children into a world where scientists predict climate change will bring bigger wildfires, more droughts, and food shortages for millions of people.

In 2018, the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the planet only has 11 years to prevent catastrophic climate change.

""You are gambling with someone else's life,"" said Cody Harrison, a 29-year-old who recently joined the group. ""If things don't go well, that human is not going to have a very good life.""

""When climate change gets worse, it multiplies other things. It's like dominoes that are falling,"" said Lori Day, another member of BirthStrike. ""It goes beyond sea level rise and storms. It affects food production, migration, resources and war.""

BirthStrike is one of a number of groups around the world that are questioning the ethics of having children in a warming world. Conceivable Future, a network of women in America, was founded in 2015 to bring awareness to ""the threat climate change poses to reproductive justice,"" although that group's members haven't discounted having children.

""The data says there's a ticking clock,"" said Josephine Ferorelli, a co-founder of the group. ""The 11-year window more or less approximates a lot of our reproductive windows as well.

""What kind of harm will a hotter and more painful world inflict on my child? Nobody has the answers for that,"" she said.

In March, US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told her 3 million Instagram followers, ""there's a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult... is it still ok to have children?""

More children, more emissions

In addition to fears surrounding the quality of life for future generations, some BirthStrikers don't want to have children because of the extra emissions that their kids, and their descendants, will produce.

Population Matters, a UK-based charity that boasts David Attenborough as a patron and aims to achieve a ""sustainable human population,"" argues that as the population increases, so will carbon emissions and and loss of tropical forests, as well as other environmental impacts.

By 2030, the UN estimates there will be around 8.5 billion people on the planet and by 2100, there could be as many as 11 billion.

Currently, the World Bank estimates the average person emits 5 tons of carbon dioxide a year.

Most of the world's projected population growth will be in developing countries, but developed nations have much higher average CO2 emissions. The average American emits 15.6 metric tons per year, while Sri Lanka and Ghana emit less than one ton per capita.

Consumption, not population?

So, should everyone in industrialized countries consider having fewer children, to reduce emissions? It might not be that simple.

A 2014 study concluded that reducing the human population is ""not a quick fix for environmental problems."" Using models, it found that even a worldwide one-child policy would give a global population of around 7 billion by the end of the century -- much the same as today's population.

The scientists concluded that although reducing population ""might benefit our great-great-great-great grandchildren,"" it is not a short-term ""elephant in the room"" solution.

Instead, the study suggests society should focus on reducing the carbon footprint we already have and limiting per-capita consumption.

""If everyone consumes the way the US did, we would need another four to six earths,"" said Meghan Kallman, co-founder of Conceivable Future. ""It's not actually about the number of people. It's how those people consume.""

""From a carbon perspective, one baby more one baby less, the way that you approach it as an individual has no significant impact whatsoever,"" said Ferorelli. ""It's about why it is so carbon intensive in the West to have a child in the first place.""

The opportunity cost of a child

Both BirthStrike and Conceivable Future are quick to say that they do not endorse coercive population control methods or judge anyone for having children.

Nor should the groups be conflated with the anti-natalist movement, the philosophy that it's morally wrong to procreate, because of the suffering that comes with life.

""I try not to judge anybody for their own choices,"" said Harrison. ""Once I'm ready I'd like to adopt.""

Day even wondered whether a child that is due to be born could be the child who solves the climate crisis.

""Sometimes I wonder, what if Greta Thunberg's mother had not wanted to have children because of climate change?"" said Day, referring to the 16-year-old girl who has inspired youth climate protests worldwide, after staging a sit-in outside the Swedish parliament every Friday.

Creating political action

For the groups, their declarations are less about individual actions and more about a collective effort to prompt political change.

""I did have a sneaky feeling that it was going to rock the boat of certain patriarchal groups,"" said Pepino. ""I wanted it to freak people out and I think that it has.""

Pepino said that there had been a ""violent backlash"" online after an interview she did on Fox News, but says now there is a lot more solidarity.

""Knowing that there are people out there who feel the same way helps us come together and say something really politically powerful,"" said Kallman. ""This is a huge freaking problem and we need to solve it right now.""

The groups also hope to channel the energy they would have used to raise children into activism and rebellion.

""I am in a position to be an activist,"" said Pepino. ""It's a stronger calling than motherhood, even though I still mourn the idea.""

""Now is the time to create the disruption and bring the system to its knees because it is just ignoring it,"" she said.

""Every day that we don't act is another day that more people will die, more species will become extinct and more likely we will be heading to a completely uninhabitable planet.""",16,0.6956521739130435,1,0.043478260869565216,"BirthStrike: Refusing to have kids, because of climate change","Climate change is rapidly changing the environment we live in.

The BirthStrikers have decided they can't bring children into a world where scientists predict climate change will bring bigger wildfires, more droughts, and food shortages for millions of people.In 2018, the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the planet only has 11 years to prevent catastrophic climate change. ""You are gambling with someone else's life,"" said Cody Harrison, a 29-year-old who recently joined the group. ""If things don't go well, that human is not going to have a very good life."" ""When climate change gets worse, it multiplies other things. It's like dominoes that are falling,"" said Lori Day, another member of BirthStrike. ""It goes beyond sea level rise and storms. It affects food production, migration, resources and war.""  <br><br><br><br> <br><br>< PREVIOUS SLIDE<br><br>SLIDE 1 of 3<br><br>NEXT SLIDE ><br><br><br><br><br>Blythe Pepino has decided not to have biological children because of her fears about climate change.  <br>(c) Dani Riot<br><br><br>BirthStrike is one of a number of groups around the world that are questioning the ethics of having children in a warming world. Conceivable Future, a network of women in America, was founded in 2015 to bring awareness to ""the threat climate change poses to reproductive justice,"" although that group's members haven't discounted having children.""The data says there's a ticking clock,"" said Josephine Ferorelli, a co-founder of the group. ""The 11-year window more or less approximates a lot of our reproductive windows as well. ""What kind of harm will a hotter and more painful world inflict on my child? Nobody has the answers for that,"" she said.   In March, US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told her 3 million Instagram followers, ""there's a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult... is it still ok to have children?"" In addition to fears surrounding the quality of life for future generations, some BirthStrikers don't want to have children because of the extra emissions that their kids, and their descendants, will produce. Population Matters, a UK-based charity that boasts David Attenborough as a patron and aims to achieve a ""sustainable human population,"" argues that as the population increases, so will carbon emissions and and loss of tropical forests, as well as other environmental impacts.By 2030, the UN estimates there will be around 8.5 billion people on the planet and by 2100, there could be as many as 11 billion. Currently, the World Bank estimates the average person emits 5 tons of carbon dioxide a year. Most of the world's projected population growth will be in developing countries, but developed nations have much higher average CO2 emissions. The average American emits 15.6 metric tons per year, while Sri Lanka and Ghana emit less than one ton per capita. So, should everyone in industrialized countries consider having fewer children, to reduce emissions? It might not be that simple. A 2014 study concluded that reducing the human population is ""not a quick fix for environmental problems."" Using models, it found that even a worldwide one-child policy would give a global population of around 7 billion by the end of the century -- much the same as today's population.   The scientists concluded that although reducing population ""might benefit our great-great-great-great grandchildren,"" it is not a short-term ""elephant in the room"" solution.Instead, the study suggests society should focus on reducing the carbon footprint we already have and limiting per-capita consumption. ""If everyone consumes the way the US did, we would need another four to six earths,"" said Meghan Kallman, co-founder of Conceivable Future. ""It's not actually about the number of people. It's how those people consume."" ""From a carbon perspective, one baby more one baby less, the way that you approach it as an individual has no significant impact whatsoever,"" said Ferorelli. ""It's about why it is so carbon intensive in the West to have a child in the first place."" Both BirthStrike and Conceivable Future are quick to say that they do not endorse coercive population control methods or judge anyone for having children.Nor should the groups be conflated with the anti-natalist movement, the philosophy that it's morally wrong to procreate, because of the suffering that comes with life.""I try not to judge anybody for their own choices,"" said Harrison. ""Once I'm ready I'd like to adopt."" Day even wondered whether a child that is due to be born could be the child who solves the climate crisis. ""Sometimes I wonder, what if Greta Thunberg's mother had not wanted to have children because of climate change?"" said Day, referring to the 16-year-old girl who has inspired youth climate protests worldwide, after staging a sit-in outside the Swedish parliament every Friday. For the groups, their declarations are less about individual actions and more about a collective effort to prompt political change. ""I did have a sneaky feeling that it was going to rock the boat of certain patriarchal groups,"" said Pepino. ""I wanted it to freak people out and I think that it has.""Pepino said that there had been a ""violent backlash"" online after an interview she did on Fox News, but says now there is a lot more solidarity. ""Knowing that there are people out there who feel the same way helps us come together and say something really politically powerful,"" said Kallman. ""This is a huge freaking problem and we need to solve it right now.""The groups also hope to channel the energy they would have used to raise children into activism and rebellion.  ""I am in a position to be an activist,"" said Pepino. ""It's a stronger calling than motherhood, even though I still mourn the idea.""""Now is the time to create the disruption and bring the system to its knees because it is just ignoring it,"" she said. ""Every day that we don't act is another day that more people will die, more species will become extinct and more likely we will be heading to a completely uninhabitable planet.""  </div>"

What, you ask, might that",0.6,1,"Friday is the Fourth of July, so if you can't dream up a new way to celebrate our nation's birth, why not consider attending an event that has been held each year since 1916. What, you ask, might that be? Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog-Eating Contest.

During the months of April, May, and June, a 13-event qualifying circuit was conducted throughout the U.S. in order to bring together the compelling talents of 16 men and 12 women who intend to compete in the finals. Before that snigger escapes your lips, let's mention the prize money. This year's winners will split a $40,000 purse. Earned, by the way, in just 10 minutes. Good work if you can get it. And what about glory? Last year an estimated 40,000 fans cheered on the proceedings.

This year, everyone expects a repeat of the past few years when winners and losers are tallied. Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut managed to scarf down 69 hot dogs, complete with buns last year, while Sonya ""the black widow"" Thomas, who was off her game, inhaled 36 dogs. (She's been known to eat 45 in competition.) Though the sprint to the finish may look fun, it can't be easy when one of the key rules of the game is no vomiting. And don't even think about cheating with the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE) watching.

So how do they do it -- what goes on deep inside the bowels of these champs?

Since the average stomach comfortably holds a liter of food, Dr. Marc Levine of the University of Pennsylvania wanted to see what was happening inside the stomachs of a competitive eater during a speed-eating contest. So Levine and his team of researchers X-rayed the stomachs of a competitive eater and a normal person as they both ate hot dogs. What did they see? The competitive eaters' stomach appeared to be able to expand more than those of average people, forming ""an enormous flaccid sac capable of accommodating huge amounts of food,"" they wrote in their 2007 study.

""I guess I'm fortunate in that my body will have digested what I eat within 8 to 12 hours,"" writes Thomas on her website, ""By the next day -- or late that same day -- I'm usually 'good to go.'"" Well, OK!

A single Nathan's hotdog is 300 calories, give or take. Chestnut and Thomas, then, consume within 10 minutes 20,700 and 13,500 calories, respectively. With daily calorie recommendations ranging between 1,800 and 2,500 per day, this amounts to more than a few days' worth of energy consumed in just minutes. (Burp.) Hot dogs also contain a lot of sodium, which can have killer effects on the body when consumed in high quantities, causing a person to feel faint.

Levine and his co-authors surmised, based on all the salt and calories, your average competitive eater would eventually develop morbid obesity, intractable nausea and vomiting, and gastroparesis (when the muscles inside the stomach no longer work). Someday, they may even require a gastrectomy -- surgical removal of part of the stomach. ""Despite its growing popularity, competitive speed eating is a potentially self-destructive form of behavior,"" wrote Levine and his co-authors.

Th",0.4,1,"For some people, menstrual cramps are no big deal, but for others, they're truly hellish: the throbbing or tightening pain in the lower abdomen, the nausea, the vomiting, the fatigue, the diarrhea. The symptoms can be truly debilitating and can last anywhere from 12 to 72 hours.

To alleviate the pain, your first thought may be to grab a bottle of Midol and cross your fingers, hoping it'll subside stat. But there are several natural ways to relieve menstrual cramps as well.

More: These Natural Remedies Will Help You Make It Through PMS

Apply heat

Grab a heating pad -- applying heat to your abdomen and lower back may relieve the pain.

According to a 2012 study in BMC Women's Health, women 18 to 30 years old who used a heat patch (at 104 degrees F) found it was just as effective as taking ibuprofen. Heating pads and patches are available at drugstores, but if you don't have any at home, you can use a hot water bottle, too. And according to the Mayo Clinic, soaking in a hot bath may also ease menstrual cramps.

Exercise

You may not want to, but forcing yourself to get up and get moving may actually alleviate cramping because the endorphins released by exercise counteract the effects of prostaglandins (hormones). According to a 2008 study in Sports Medicine, exercise may not only reduce menstrual pain but may also reduce or even eliminate the need for pain-relief medication.

""[The exercise] doesn't need to be super strenuous,"" Petra Casey, associate professor of OB-GYN at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told U.S. News in 2014. ""Just a walk or jog or going to the gym and taking a yoga class can really help.""

Take a yoga class

Speaking of yoga, give this exercise a try next time your symptoms set in. According to a 2011 study in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, three yoga poses (cobra, cat and fish poses) significantly reduced the intensity of pain and also cut down on the length of pain during menstruation.

More: How to Navigate Yoga While You Have Your Period

Have an orgasm

Yes, you read that right: Aim for the big 'O' while on your period.

When you have a vaginal orgasm, your brain may release endorphins and oxytocin. In fact, a 1985 study in the journal Pain found that vaginal self-stimulation doubled a person's tolerance for pain.

""Women describe clitoral orgasms as more localized and external and vaginal orgasms as being internal and involving the whole body,"" Dr. Barry Komisaruk, a psychology professor at Rutgers University who studies the female orgasm, told the BBC in 2015. ""That's probably because the nerves that carry sensations from the clitoris are different from the nerves from the vagina.""

Drink tea

According to the Mayo Clinic, you should avoid alcohol because it can make menstrual cramps worse. However, you can drink all the tea you want. ""Raspberry leaf is known for eliminating cramps and yarrow is known for regulating blood flow, so I make sure those are my main ingredients in my tea,"" holistic health care practitioner Amanda Campbell tells SheKnows. ""I notice a definite improvement when it comes to my energy levels and just general feeling of 'ick.'""

Take dietary supplements, including magnesium

The Mayo Clinic also suggests taking certain dietary supplements while on your period, including Vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B6 and magnesium. A 2001 study in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews showed that these supplements may reduce menstrual cramps.

""PMS is considered to worsen with constipation and toxicity. Magnesium is a natural detoxifier and muscle relaxer and helps with constipation and painful cramps,"" Dr. Carolyn Dean, a medical advisory board member of the nonprofit Nutritional Magnesium Association, told SheKnows.

So, the next time your cramps become unbearable, you might want to try some of these natural (and, in many cases, free) options. Who knows -- you might find something that works really well for you.

A version of this article was originally published in August 2011.",13,0.65,1,0.05,How to Relieve Horrible Menstrual Cramps — the Natural Way,"For some people, menstrual cramps are no big deal, but for others, they're truly hellish: the throbbing or tightening pain in the lower abdomen, the nausea, the vomiting, the fatigue, the diarrhea. The symptoms can be truly debilitating and can last anywhere from 12 to 72 hours.

To alleviate the pain, your first thought may be to grab a bottle of Midol and cross your fingers, hoping it'll subside stat. But there are several natural ways to relieve menstrual cramps as well.

Apply heat

Grab a heating pad -- applying heat to your abdomen and lower back may relieve the pain.

According to a 2012 study in BMC Women's Health, women 18 to 30 years old who used a heat patch (at 104 degrees F) found it was just as effective as taking ibuprofen. Heating pads and patches are available at drugstores, but if you don't have any at home, you can use a hot water bottle, too. And according to the Mayo Clinic, soaking in a hot bath may also ease menstrual cramps.

Exercise

You may not want to, but forcing yourself to get up and get moving may actually alleviate cramping because the endorphins released by exercise counteract the effects of prostaglandins (hormones). According to a 2008 study in Sports Medicine, exercise may not only reduce menstrual pain but may also reduce or even eliminate the need for pain-relief medication.

""[The exercise] doesn't need to be super strenuous,"" Petra Casey, associate professor of OB-GYN at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told U.S. News in 2014. ""Just a walk or jog or going to the gym and taking a yoga class can really help.""

Take a yoga class

Speaking of yoga, give this exercise a try next time your symptoms set in. According to a 2011 study in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, three yoga poses (cobra, cat and fish poses) significantly reduced the intensity of pain and also cut down on the length of pain during menstruation.

Have an orgasm

Yes, you read that right: Aim for the big 'O' while on your period.

When you have a vaginal orgasm, your brain may release endorphins and oxytocin. In fact, a 1985 study in the journal Pain found that vaginal self-stimulation doubled a person's tolerance for pain.

""Women describe clitoral orgasms as more localized and external and vaginal orgasms as being internal and involving the whole body,"" Dr. Barry Komisaruk, a psychology professor at Rutgers University who studies the female orgasm, told the BBC in 2015. ""That's probably because the nerves that carry sensations from the clitoris are different from the nerves from the vagina.""

Drink tea

According to the Mayo Clinic, you should avoid alcohol because it can make menstrual cramps worse. However, you can drink all the tea you want. ""Raspberry leaf is known for eliminating cramps and yarrow is known for regulating blood flow, so I make sure those are my main ingredients in my tea,"" holistic health care practitioner Amanda Campbell tells SheKnows. ""I notice a definite improvement when it comes to my energy levels and just general feeling of 'ick.'""

Take dietary supplements, including magnesium

The Mayo Clinic also suggests taking certain dietary supplements while on your period, including Vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B6 and magnesium. A 2001 study in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews showed that these supplements may reduce menstrual cramps.

""PMS is considered to worsen with constipation and toxicity. Magnesium is a natural detoxifier and muscle relaxer and helps with constipation and painful cramps,"" Dr. Carolyn Dean, a medical advisory board member of the nonprofit Nutritional Magnesium Association, told SheKnows. ""If the bowel doesn't empty once a day, toxins can be reabsorbed back into the body from the colon. The longer debris sits in the colon, the more fluid is reabsorbed, making stools more solid and difficult to pass.""

""Collectively these results demonstrate that insulin itself may be directly toxic to the early human placenta but that metformin can prevent these deleterious effects,"" wrote Mario Vega, MD, of Columbia University Fertility Center, New York, and his colleagues. ""If confirmed in animal and human studies, this would indicate that screening and treatment for insulin resistance should focus on hyperinsulinemia.""

Dr. Vega and his colleagues cultivated trophoblast cells from three healthy women scheduled for manual vacuum aspiration during the first trimester of pregnancy to study the effects of insulin exposure alone, while trophoblast cells were cultured from a different set of women for the insulin and metformin follow-up experiments. The researchers tested each experiment against a control group of cultivated lung fibroblast cells. Insulin was measured in doses of 0.2 nmol, 1 nmol, and 5 nmol, while metformin was measured at 10 micromol. The primary outcome measures examined were gamma-H2AX for DNA damage, cell proliferation assay for cell survival, and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis.

Within 48 hours, the cultures showed DNA damage and induction of apoptosis when exposed to 1 nmol of insulin, but researchers said pretreatment with metformin prevented these effects. Exposing cells to metformin after insulin reduced but did not eliminate the effects of insulin.

The researchers noted the study is limited because the effects of insulin and metformin have not been examined in vivo, and it is not known at what level insulin causes damage. In addition, they suggested downregulation of genes in trophoblasts caused by insulin could cause apoptosis and DNA damage to trophoblast cells.

""Although studies performed on kidney and colon cells suggest that one possible mechanism of action for insulin-mediated genotoxicity is through AKT activation of mitochondria and subsequent reactive oxygen species production, the exact mechanism is poorly understood,"" Dr. Vega and colleagues said. ""Future studies will be necessary to determine variability among subjects, as well as mechanisms of action through which insulin exerts its cytotoxicity and genotoxicity.""

This study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health Human Placenta Project. The authors reported no relevant financial disclosures.

The pioneering study was led by the University of Sheffield's School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), with business experts from UEA and Loughborough University, and funded by the Medical Research Council.

Using weekly product-level supermarket prices for 254 alcohol products, the researchers analysed how prices changed in response to tax changes. They examined drinks sold at different price points and in four categories: beers, ciders, spirits and wines.

The findings, published today in the journal Addiction, showed that supermarkets responded to tax increases by subsidising prices of cheaper products. Price rises for cheaper products were up to 15 per cent below the level expected if the tax increase had been passed on fully.

Although under-shifting affected around one in six of all product lines, these drinks account for a large proportion of total sales: approximately 68 per cent of beer, 38 per cent spirits and 31 per cent of cider sales.

There is a likely implication on health with previous research showing the heaviest 5 per cent of drinkers in the UK population, classified as higher-risk drinkers according to NHS guidelines, buy 33 per cent of all shop-bought alcohol and favour cheaper supermarket products. Subsidising cheaper alcohol when taxes are increased is likely to lead to smaller reductions in excessive alcohol consumption, and consequently smaller reductions in the harms caused by excessive alcohol than if tax rises were passed on in full.

Paul Dobson, professor of Business Strategy and Public Policy at UEA, said: ""Subsidising cheap alcohol might be attractive to supermarkets in their efforts to increase the number and frequency of store visits that shoppers make, but it is socially irresponsible when it encourages excessive consumption.

""It is imperative that the Government take a much closer look at how taxes and duty are applied on alcohol and consider more targeted measures to address dangerous levels of consumption of cheap alcohol.""

Prof Petra Meier, principal investigator from Sheffield Alcohol Research Group (SARG) at the University of Sheffield, said: ""The Government has identified the ready availability of cheap alcohol as a key influence on the UK's high rates of alcohol-related harm. Alcohol duty increases can be part of a mix of measures to tackle this problem.

""Our new research shows that, after a tax increase, supermarkets appear to subsidise those cheaper products and pass more of the tax increases onto the mid-range and more expensive products. Because these cheaper products are the ones which tend to be favoured by high-risk drinkers, the implication is that this could hinder efforts to reduce harmful drinking.""

Last year ScHARR reported that the Government's introduction of the ban on below-cost selling, which would prevent retailers selling alcohol cheaper than the cost of the tax payable on the product, would have a negligible impact on the consumption of alcohol and related harms in comparison with a 45p minimum unit price for alcohol.

Heavy drinkers and alcoholics share genetic similarities but also exhibit key differences, a massive new genome-wide analysis published April 2 in the journal Nature Communications found.

Researchers at Yale School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania searched for genetic variants among individuals with a history of heavy drinking and those identified as having alcohol use disorder. The study included 274,000 subjects enrolled in the United States Veterans Administration's Million Veteran Program.

The researchers found 18 distinct risk regions overall: five were associated with both groups, eight were connected with heavy drinkers only, and five were linked only to alcoholism.

""There tended to be more variants associated with neuronal function"" in the alcohol use disorder group, said senior author Joel Gelernter, the Foundations Fund Professor of Psychiatry and professor of genetics and of neuroscience at Yale.

Researchers also found that gene variants linked to alcoholism are significantly associated with the genetic risk of developing a variety of other psychiatric disorders.

Twin studies and other research have shown that genetics accounts for about half of the overall risk for alcoholism.

The findings ""may have longer term clinical implications in diagnosing risk and developing medication,"" Gelernter said.

Hang Zhou of Yale is a co-lead author of the paper. Henry R. Kranzler and Rachel L. Kember of UPenn are co-lead authors.

Primary funding for the study was provided by the U.S. Veterans Administration.

In hindsight, the Alzheimer's research and development community of the past fifteen years or so has been a strange place. The vast, overwhelming majority of investment has gone towards attempts to clear amyloid-b in later stage Alzheimer's disease, largely via immunotherapies. This strategy has failed, over and again, long past the point at which it was defensible to blame that failure on the challenging nature of the underlying projects to first make immunotherapies work at all, and then to make them work in the brain. Enormous sums were spent on repeated attempts to clear amyloid-b even as the research community was settling on the consensus that aggregation of amyloid-b is a feature of early Alzheimer's. It only causes mild cognitive impairment on its own, but sets the stage for the later accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. It is tau aggregates and their surrounding biochemistry that cause the real harm, the severe dysfunction and death of neurons.

Where years of relentless failure did not move the leaders who determined strategy for Alzheimer's development at the large scale, the rise of plausible, much cheaper alternatives has finally produced motion. Large anti-amyloid programs are being cancelled, trial development halted. It is becoming apparent that low cost senolytics have a large effect on late stage Alzheimer's disease animal models, perhaps more so than many of the immunotherapies when they were tested in mice. Meanwhile, groups are working on drainage or filtration of cerebrospinal fluid, which should clear out a usefully large fraction of all of the protein aggregates involved in neurodegeneration, again much more cheaply than immunotherapies. Other researchers are focused on removing bacterial and viral contributions to amyloid buildup and neuroinflammation.

Ironically, just as this flourishing of alternative and potentially more cost effective development programs takes place, some of the anti-amyloid immunotherapies are finally starting to achieve their goals, to remove significant amounts of amyloid-b from the human brain. Yet they haven't moved the needle on patient outcomes. This upheaval, when taken as a whole, seems a positive development. The old industry is being disrupted by the growth of a new industry. Bad investments are being cleared out, and more productive new investments are being made. The Alzheimer's research community of the early 2020s will be a much more diverse ecosystem with a greater expectation of success.

Biogen/Eisai Halt Phase 3 Aducanumab Trials

Today, Biogen and Eisai announced they would terminate the Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE trials of aducanumab for early Alzheimer's disease. A futility analysis run by an independent data-monitoring committee concluded that that trials would not reach their primary endpoint, the slowing of cognitive decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody that helps clear amyloid-b (Ab) from the brain. The trials had recruited more than 3,200 patients around the world.

""This tells us that removal of amyloid in people with disease is too late. Amyloid is a disease trigger. Once the neurodegenerative disease process is up and running, it is up and running. Even though this trial was in the early symptomatic phase of AD, it is still in the phase when Ab is no longer likely to be the driving process but where tau and inflammation probably are. I think Ab is still a good target for the primary and maybe secondary prevention trials of AD, before tau and inflammation have started driving the disease. I think this solidifies the opinion that amyloid-targeted therapies do not have a clinical effect at the symptomatic stages of the disease process. Might anti-amyloid therapies work prior to the development of symptoms? Maybe, but with no symptomatic signal, it is risky to continue in that space. We clearly need other targets, and tau is the leading candidate for now.""

Alzheimer's Drug Failure Leaves Scientists Seeking New Direction

The brain has been a black box for drug developers, but focusing on beta amyloid has long been viewed as the best hope for treating the mysterious ailment that affects millions of Americans and their families. For many, the hypothesis became an article of faith, motivating billions of dollars in research spending and putting thousands of patients through clinical trials. ""It's not science anymore. It has turned into a religion.""

Biogen and Eisai will discontinue two late-stage trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug, aducanumab, which has cost the partners more than $830 million over the past three years. The results showed that the drug was unlikely to help patients, the companies said in a statement, and the discontinuation wasn't related to safety concerns. The latest failure, following the unraveling of similar experimental beta amyloid drugs from Eli Lilly & Co., and Pfizer Inc. in large-scale trials, has scientists questioning whether the persistent focus on targeting the compound has prevented investment in testing drugs against other possible Alzheimer's targets. Even so, researchers had thought that perhaps the Biogen compound might be different from previous failures.

There was a plausible hypothesis that somehow got proved in the animal model (no surprise, since they are quite poor replication of what happens in the human brain after decades of damage accumulation). Then there was a really advanced treatment, which didn't help with the outcomes. Therefore, the theory is disproven. I am still surprised that there was no measurable benefit. Even if the tau aggregation is the main culprit , removing the amyloid should help, if only by merely clearing the pro-tau forming environment. So there are quite a few unknowns here. On top of that, having the know-how to selectively clean compounds using the immune system or antibodies might be useful somewhere else@Ira S. Pastor
Hmm, good to know what to avoid as investment.On the other hand, they might still be lucky and the cleanup of the amyloid might be required but not sufficient condition to reverse or slow AD. We shell see. However, those 18 $B could have been spent better...It's the perenial problem in biology, a problem perturbs a whole host of biochemichal factors, some elevates, some depress, we take a single observation that X or Y is elevated or depressed in that disease and therefore must cause it!It was a fair shot though based on the etiology of the familial form, but we desperately need new approaches. It's untenable now not to know that dementia's etiology is multifactorial, amyloid is a unspecific respons and is not evolved to harm you. A way forward is to focus on inflammation-causing processes in the brain, from viruses to heavy metals to metabolic derangement.I agree that canceling this uselles research is good thing for the rejuvenating biotechonogy. Many people are whinning that this is a catastrophe . Of course, no -- this is just a cleaning .

If you're still forgetting things, whether it's picking up milk on your way home from work or packing your umbrella for a rainy day, you're in luck: According to a new study, if you're wondering how to improve your memory, acting out the things you're trying to remember might just help the information stick in your brain.

The study, published in the journal Neuropsychology, asked 96 participants a including people ""with mild cognitive impairment"" between 64 and 87 years old, according to ScienceDaily, as well as healthy adults between 62 and 84 years old, and young adults between 18 and 22 years old a to remember future tasks by acting them out in advance. While the study mainly focused on determining whether the practice would improve the memories of older people who were potentially in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers found that both older and millennial-age participants were able to successfully improve their memory using this unique strategy.

Dr. Antonina Pereira, a lead researcher on the study from the University of Chichester in England, explained in a statement that acting out the thing you're trying to remember, as weird as it may sound, really is the key to improving your memory. ""The next time you would like to remember to pick up a pint of milk from the store on your way home,"" she said, ""do not wait until you have got home to realize you have forgotten to do it. Instead, recreate the action you would like to remember, pretending that you are actually doing it, in as much vivid detail as possible.""

This detail is key, according to Dr. Pereira. Don't just passively imagine yourself going through the motions of something. Instead, harness the incredible power of visualization, and immerse yourself deeply in the scene, no matter how strange it may feel.

If you're looking to keep information in your brain after you learn about it, try exercising a few hours after you learn something new.

Those workout endorphins are apparently great for more than just improving your mood. A study published in Current Biology found that working out four hours after you learn something new can significantly boost your ability to recall the information later on. If you're still in school, this could be a great way to get outside and take a memory-boosting study break. And even if you're living the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. life and exams are in the distant past, this method can still help you out. For instance, if you're trying to learn a new language, or even a cooking technique you've been practicing, try hitting the gym or doing a quick home workout after practicing that skill. Just be sure to wait a little while for your workout, because this study found that while the four-hour mark boosted memory, exercising immediately after the fact didn't.

If you're more of a nap person than a gym rat, your time cuddled up on the couch might be able to improve your memory as well. According to a study published in the journal PLOS One, your afternoon snooze could ensure that your mind holds onto whatever new information you've fed it, as the research found that naps, regardless of how long they last, ""closely resembled memory improvement after an eight-hour night of sleep."" Whether it's a new skill or an important fact, getting in those Zs is clearly great for your brain.

And, in what may be the best news of the century, eating chocolate could actually help things stick in your brain, too.

A study published in the journal Physiology & Behavior revealed that certain nutrients in dark chocolate can actually increase blood flow to different parts of your brain, thus improving your ability to recall newly learned information. So the next time you're wondering whether you should have a chocolate croissant for breakfast, remember that it's literally brain food.

""The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experiences,"" - Eleanor Roosevelt

There's nothing more dreadful than waking up each day to that feeling of not knowing where your life is heading. Therefore, the outcome of a new study that reveals that having a purpose in life makes you live longer seems convincing.

""Our findings point to the fact that deciding on a direction in life and setting overarching goals for oneself can help one live longer, regardless of when one finds his or her purpose,"" said Patrick Hill, lead research of the study from Carleton University in Canada, in a press release. ""So, the earlier someone decides on a purpose, the earlier they'll benefit from the effects.""

So, what's the logic behind this? Researchers noted that people who set goals and targets for themselves feel more self-worth, live a healthier life and have a positive outlook towards life. Coincidentally, these are the ingredients to a longer life.

For the study, researchers looked at data of 6,000 adult participants who were asked about their purpose in life. Researchers also collected data that measured each participant's personal relationship with others, and positive and negative emotions.

A follow-up study was conducted 14 years later where researchers found that 9 percent of the participants had died. Looking into the previously collected data, researchers found that most of the participants who had died reported little to no purpose in life and fewer positive relations. On the contrary, the participants who reported a purpose in life lived longer, irrespective of their age or gender.

""There are a lot of reasons to believe that being purposeful might help protect older adults more so than younger ones,"" Hill said in the release. ""For instance, adults might need a sense of direction more, after they leave the workplace and lose that source for organizing their daily events.""

A similar study conducted earlier this year found that being in control of your life and believing you can achieve goals despite all barriers can help you lead a healthier and longer life.

Middle-aged patients with higher levels of coronary artery calcium buildup were more likely to have higher left ventricular mass and worse left ventricular function of the heart, pa",0.3333333333333333,1,"Study Highlights:

Middle-aged patients with higher levels of coronary artery calcium buildup were more likely to have higher left ventricular mass and worse left ventricular function of the heart, particularly among blacks.

Higher coronary artery calcium scores may be a marker for future heart failure.

Coronary artery calcium testing may help detect asymptomatic abnormalities among at-risk populations.

DALLAS -- Higher coronary artery calcium levels in middle-age were associated with structural heart abnormalities linked to future heart failure, particularly among blacks, according to new research in Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging, anAmerican Heart Association journal.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is the buildup of calcified plaque made up of fat, calcium and cholesterol. The calcium found in this type of plaque is not related to dietary calcium. Elevated cholesterol levels in the blood can contribute to plaque buildup, known as atherosclerosis, which narrows the channel within an artery and reduces blood flow.

CAC is a risk marker for heart health problems, and CAC screening was added to the American Heart Association's 2018 cholesterol management guidelines to further improve early detection of heart health abnormalities, especially among people who might be at a higher risk. A CAC score of zero indicates there is low risk in the absence of other high-risk conditions, while a score above zero indicates increasing risk.In this study, researchers tracked 2,449 people (52% white, 57% women) from young adulthood to middle-age. Non-invasive computed tomography imaging tests were used to gauge the participants' vascular health, with participants' imaging tests and CAC scores compared at years 15 and 25 of the study period.

By year 25, participants' average age was about 50. Seventy-two percent of the group had a CAC score of zero compared with 77% a decade earlier.

""We looked at early adulthood to middle-age because this is a window in which we can see abnormalities that might not be causing symptoms, but could later increase the risk of heart problems,"" said Henrique Turin Moreira, M.D., Ph.D., study co-author and an attending physician at Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. ""Prevention and control of these abnormalities are key, so early identification of risks can be crucial.""

Moreira and team found that increases in CAC scores were independently related to increasing age, male sex, black race, higher systolic blood pressure, higher total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus and current smoking, as well as the use of medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Additionally, they found:

Compared with patients who had CAC scores of zero, those who had higher CAC scores at middle-age had a 12% increase in left ventricular mass and a 9% increase in left ventricular volume, independent of other risk factors including demographic information and cardiovascular risks. Abnormalities in the left ventricle means the heart had to work harder to effectively pump blood, and as a result, became enlarged and thickened, a risk factor for heart failure.

These findings were even more significant among blacks. For every one-unit change in a CAC score, blacks had four times higher increase in left ventricular mass compared with whites.

While progression in CAC over the follow-up was strongly related to higher left ventricular mass in blacks, this relationship was not significant in whites

Blacks already face a greater risk and burden of heart disease and stroke: 60% of adult black men and 57% of adult black women have some form of cardiovascular disease, compared with 50% of white men and 43% of white women.

""Racial differences in our findings may be due to genetic factors or perhaps greater exposure to cardiovascular risk factors that usually appear earlier in blacks,"" Moreira said. ""We need more research to examine the link between coronary artery calcium and heart health.""

""Prior studies have shown that presence of CAC and higher CAC scores are associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young to middle aged adults. The results of this study are important as they highlight that presence of CAC and higher CAC scores may also be associated with echocardiographic markers of subclinical LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction,"" said Salim Virani, M.D., a member of the writing committee for the American Heart Association's 2018 cholesterol guidelines and director of the Cardiology Fellowship Training Program at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""Given the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure, these are important findings. Prior studies from this cohort have also shown that a better risk factors profile in young adulthood is associated with much lower CAC and therefore, these results further highlight the importance of primordial prevention and risk factor modification in early adulthood.""

AMHERST, Mass. aEUR"" A new study led by associate professor Rebecca Ready in the department of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has found that older adults have different, more positive responses than young adults about feelings such as serenity, sadness and loneliness.

Ready calls the findings aEURoehighly clinically significantaEUR because the information could help caregivers, psychotherapists and workers at assisted living facilities, for example, better understand the emotions of older people in their care, which could lead to improved treatment and quality of interactions. Findings appear in the current online issue of Aging and Mental Health.

She says, aEURoeOlder adults report feeling more serenity than younger persons. They also have a richer concept of what it means to feel serene than younger persons.aEUR In a word grouping task, older adults associated more positive emotional terms with serene, such as cheerful, happy and joyful, than did younger people. The authors speculate that aEURoethis broader conception of sereneaEUR is associated with the fact that older adults report more calming positive emotions than younger people.

She adds, aEURoeWe were surprised to find that younger adults associated more self-deprecating terms with feeling sad and lonely, such as being ashamed or disgusted with themselves, than older persons.aEUR When grouping other emotion words with sadness, older adults included words such as droopy and sheepish, while younger adults included more self-deprecating terms with the word, such as dissatisfied with self, ashamed, angry and disgusted with self. A similar pattern was observed for lonely.

For this study, Ready and her graduate student Gennarina Santorelli recruited 32 older adults ages 60 to 92, and 111 younger adults ages 18 to 32, and asked them to judge 70 emotion terms on whether the words had a positive or negative connotation and if the words were activating or arousing. For example, excited is generally rated as a high activation word, while serene is associated with less activation. They then had participants group similar words together.

Ready and colleagues found the word groupings were similar between older and younger persons for many words but they noted systematic differences for sadness, loneliness and, as noted above, serenity. They also found that older adults perceive emotion terms as most positive and more active than younger persons. Emotions overall may be more stimulating for older than younger persons.

The findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is one of the first to focus on how hypertension, diabetes, obesity and elevated blood lipids contribute to cardiovascular disease in childhood cancer survivors. The research concentrated on risk factors that can often be modified with diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes. The federally funded CCSS follows survivors of childhood cancer treated at 26 medical centers in the U.S. and Canada. St. Jude is its coordinating center.

The risk was greatest for survivors whose cancer treatment had included therapies associated with heart damage. The findings suggest that risk factors linked to lifestyle, particularly hypertension, intensify the impact of those childhood cancer treatments and accelerate development of heart disease.

The findings raise hope that prevention or treatment of such risk factors might help reduce heart-related death and disability among the nation's growing population of childhood cancer survivors. For survivors, treatment-related heart disease is a leading cause of non-cancer death and disability.

The results reinforce the importance of survivors receiving annual medical screenings to check blood pressure, weight, cholesterol and other health indicators, said the study's first and corresponding author Greg Armstrong, M.D., an associate member of the St. Jude Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control. Screenings have a track record of reducing heart disease in the general population and are recommended for childhood cancer survivors. ""For doctors who are caring for survivors, the key message from this study is that aggressive management of hypertension is especially important for this population,"" Armstrong said.

Nationwide, there are an estimated 395,000 survivors of childhood cancer. With overall pediatric cancer survival rates now 80 percent, the number of survivors will continue to grow.

The study included 10,724 childhood cancer survivors, half younger than 34 years old and 3,159 siblings whose average age was 36 and who had not been diagnosed with childhood cancer. The survivors were all at least five years from their cancer diagnosis and half had survived for more than 25 years.

While similar percentages of survivors and siblings reported at least two preventable risk factors, by age 45 survivors were far more likely than the siblings to report severe, life threatening or fatal heart problems. For example, 5.3 percent of survivors, but 0.9 percent of siblings, reported a diagnosis of coronary artery disease and, 4.8 percent of survivors, but just 0.3 percent of siblings, reported suffering from heart failure.

The difference was even more dramatic when investigators focused on survivors whose cancer treatment included either chest irradiation or a class of chemotherapy drugs known as anthracyclines. Both are associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems. While treatments have changed since survivors in this study battled cancer in the 1970s and mid-1980s, anthracyclines and chest irradiation still play essential roles in childhood cancer treatments.

Such treatment-related risk left survivors with normal blood pressure at a five-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease. Researchers found survivors with the same treatment history but who had also developed hypertension were at a 37-fold increased risk. Researchers found similarly dramatic differences in the likelihood of heart failure, heart valve disease or arrhythmia depending on whether the at-risk survivors reported treatable risk factors in addition to their cancer-treatment-related risk.

The findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is one of the first to focus on how hypertension, diabetes, obesity and elevated blood lipids contribute to cardiovascular disease in childhood cancer survivors. The research concentrated on risk factors that can often be modified with diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes. The federally funded CCSS follows survivors of childhood cancer treated at 26 medical centers in the U.S. and Canada. St. Jude is its coordinating center.

The risk was greatest for survivors whose cancer treatment had included therapies associated with heart damage. The findings suggest that risk factors linked to lifestyle, particularly hypertension, intensify the impact of those childhood cancer treatments and accelerate development of heart disease.

The findings raise hope that prevention or treatment of such risk factors might help reduce heart-related death and disability among the nation's growing population of childhood cancer survivors. For survivors, treatment-related heart disease is a leading cause of non-cancer death and disability.

The results reinforce the importance of survivors receiving annual medical screenings to check blood pressure, weight, cholesterol and other health indicators, said the study's first and corresponding author Greg Armstrong, M.D., an associate member of the St. Jude Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control. Screenings have a track record of reducing heart disease in the general population and are recommended for childhood cancer survivors. ""For doctors who are caring for survivors, the key message from this study is that aggressive management of hypertension is especially important for this population,"" Armstrong said.

Nationwide, there are an estimated 395,000 survivors of childhood cancer. With overall pediatric cancer survival rates now 80 percent, the number of survivors will continue to grow.

The study included 10,724 childhood cancer survivors, half younger than 34 years old and 3,159 siblings whose average age was 36 and who had not been diagnosed with childhood cancer. The survivors were all at least five years from their cancer diagnosis and half had survived for more than 25 years.

While similar percentages of survivors and siblings reported at least two preventable risk factors, by age 45 survivors were far more likely than the siblings to report severe, life threatening or fatal heart problems. For example, 5.3 percent of survivors, but 0.9 percent of siblings, reported a diagnosis of coronary artery disease and, 4.8 percent of survivors, but just 0.3 percent of siblings, reported suffering from heart failure.

The difference was even more dramatic when investigators focused on survivors whose cancer treatment included either chest irradiation or a class of chemotherapy drugs known as anthracyclines. Both are associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems. While treatments have changed since survivors in this study battled cancer in the 1970s and mid-1980s, anthracyclines and chest irradiation still play essential roles in childhood cancer treatments.

Such treatment-related risk left survivors with normal blood pressure at a five-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease. Researchers found survivors with the same treatment history but who had also developed hypertension were at a 37-fold increased risk. Researchers found similarly dramatic differences in the likelihood of heart failure, heart valve disease or arrhythmia depending on whether the at-risk survivors reported treatable risk factors in addition to their cancer-treatment-related risk.

""For survivors whose cancer treatment included cardio-toxic therapy, we found that preventable factors, particularly hypertension, resulted in a risk beyond what is likely from a simple additive effect,"" Armstrong said. Having both treatment-associated risk and hypertension resulted in double-digit excess risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure and other serious heart problems.

The team recruited 36 volunteers, aged 18 to 39, to stay at the Clinical Translational Research Center at the Anschutz Medical Campus for two weeks so their eating, light exposure, and sleep could be monitored.

They were divided into three groups: one group had nine hours sleep a night, the second had five hours per night, while the third group had five hours for five days then were allowed to sleep in as much as they liked for two days -- like a weekend -- before returning to five hour nights for the remainder of their stay.

The groups who had restricted sleep snacked more at night, gained weight, and saw declines in insulin sensitivity -- the hormone that helps our body regulate sugar levels. The ""weekend"" group saw mild improvements, but the effects didn't last.

In fact, the weekend group actually came out worse for insulin sensitivity, which declined by 9 to 27%, and was worse in the muscles and liver than the other groups. Severely reduced insulin sensitivy over time can lead to the development of diabetes.

""It could be that the yo-yoing back and forth -- changing the time we eat, changing our circadian clock, and then going back to insufficient sleep is uniquely disruptive,"" said Wright.

It's hard to get enough sleep during the week, especially if you're a night owl and you have a 9 to 5 job. But research has consistently shown that the best thing for you is to stick to a bedtime, and try and wake up at the same time every day.

However, last year, a couple of studies suggested there were benefits to sleeping in at the weekend. One published in the journal Sleep looked at the sleeping habits and overall health of 43,000 people and found that those who slept less than five hours a night, or more than 8 hours a night, had much higher rates of mortality than those who slept more. Overall, it was the average amount of sleep somebody got that seemed to make a difference.

At the time, Torbjorn Akerstedt, a biological psychology professor at the Center for Stress Research at Stockholm University and lead author of the study, said: ""It seems like you actually can compensate by catching up on sleep during weekends. This is in effect an argument for lazing around all weekend. There probably is an upper limit, but it's anyway better to increase [sleep hours] on the weekend rather than not doing it at all.""

A follow-up study using the same data found that adults under age 65 who got only five hours of sleep or less a night, for seven days a week, had a higher risk of early death than those who consistently got six or seven hours. But those who made up for it at the weekend by sleeping in had no raised mortality risk compared with the steady sleepers.

""The results imply that short (weekday) sleep is not a risk factor for mortality if it is combined with a medium or long weekend sleep,"" said Akerstedt. ""This suggests that short weekday sleep may be compensated for during the weekend, and that this has implications for mortality.""

The ""weekend"" group saw mild improvements, but the effects didn't last.<br><br>In fact, the weekend group actually came out worse for insulin sensitivity, which declined by 9 to 27%, and was worse in the muscles and liver than the other groups. Severely reduced insulin sensitivy over time can lead to the development of diabetes.<br><br>""It could be that the yo-yoing back and forth -- changing the time we eat, changing our circadian clock, and then going back to insufficient sleep is uniquely disruptive,"" said Wright.<br><br>Read more: You might be better at sports at certain times of day thanks to your biological clock<br><br>It's hard to get enough sleep during the week, especially if you're a night owl and you have a 9 to 5 job. But research has consistently shown that the best thing for you is to stick to a bedtime, and try and wake up at the same time every day.<br><br>However, last year, a couple of studies suggested there were benefits to sleeping in at the weekend. One published in the journal Sleep looked at the sleeping habits and overall health of 43,000 people and found that those who slept less than five hours a night, or more than 8 hours a night, had much higher rates of mortality than those who slept more. Overall, it was the average amount of sleep somebody got that seemed to make a difference.<br><br>At the time, Torbjorn Akerstedt, a biological psychology professor at the Center for Stress Research at Stockholm University and lead author of the study, said: ""It seems like you actually can compensate by catching up on sleep during weekends. This is in effect an argument for lazing around all weekend. There probably is an upper limit, but it's anyway better to increase [sleep hours] on the weekend rather than not doing it at all.""<br><br>A follow-up study using the same data found that adults under age 65 who got only five hours of sleep or less a night, for seven days a week, had a higher risk of early death than those who consistently got six or seven hours. But those who made up for it at the weekend by sleeping in had no raised mortality risk compared with the steady sleepers.<br><br>""The results imply that short (weekday) sleep is not a risk factor for mortality if it is combined with a medium or long weekend sleep,"" said Akerstedt. ""This suggests that short weekday sleep may be compensated for during the weekend, and that this has implications for mortality.""<br><br>Read more: Sleeping in at the weekend might actually be good for you, according to a new study<br><br>Overall, sleep researchers generally agree that the best way to sleep is consistently, and while sleeping in is sometimes fine, there's no substitute for getting enough hours every night.<br><br>In the new study, people in the weekend group recovered slightly after sleeping in, but then found it harder to fall asleep Sunday night, making it even harder to get up on Monday morning<br><br>Wright said there may be some value in sleeping in for people who occasionally have a late night, but more research needs to be done to know how beneficial it could be. </div>"

So what sho",0.35714285714285715,1,"We've all been there, you're desperate for the loo, and frantically hunting for a toilet, only to find when you get there, that the seat is covered with ""droplets"" from the previous user.

So what should you do - carry on regardless, or try and squat while you do your business?

The world is in many ways a microbial planet and, as its inhabitants, we carry within us our own microscopic rain forests - which we exchange with the environment and each other all the time.

Microbes are abundant throughout the human body, including the skin, mouth, eyes, urinary and genital organs and gastrointestinal tracts. Most people carry up to a kilogram of microorganisms.

These are largely within the gut and comprise bacteria, fungi, yeast, viruses and sometimes parasites.

Research has shown that microbes from your gut make up 25-54 percent of faecal matter.

Human faeces can carry a wide range of transmissible pathogens: Campylobacter, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Yersinia bacteria - as well as viruses such as norovirus, rotavirus and hepatitis A and E, just to name a few.

So of course, there is always going to be an infection risk in encountering faecal matter, but is there a serious risk of catching an infection from a public toilet?

Peeing in public

Developing an infection from your bottom sitting on a toilet seat is very unlikely, as most intestinal diseases involve hand-to-mouth transfer of bacteria as a result of faecal contamination of hands, food and surfaces.

Human skin is also covered by a layer of bacteria and yeast which functions as a highly effective protective shield. Underlying this is your immune system which is ferociously good at protecting you from ""dirty"" pathogens.

So there is no need to squat over the toilet bowel. In fact, squatting may actually cause injury or increase the risk of infection. As women's health physical therapist Brianne Grogan explains:

The problem with ""hovering"" over the toilet when urinating is that the muscles of your pelvic floor and pelvic girdle - your hip rotators, gluten, back and abs - are extremely tense. This pelvic girdle tension makes it difficult for urine to flow easily, often requiring you to push or ""bear down"" slightly to make the urine come out quickly. Frequent pushing or bearing down to urinate can contribute to pelvic organ prolapse.

Grogan added that this might lead to incomplete emptying of the bladder which could ultimately cause increased frequency and urgency of urination, or in extreme cases even contribute to the increased likelihood of a bladder infection.

The dirty door handle

A person's microbial and immune defences provide strong protection against the infection challenges of visiting a public toilet.

And also, because of the recognition of the infection risk of faecal matter, in most developed countries public toilets are regularly cleaned.

But for reassurance you could carry a small pack of antiseptic wipes and clean the toilet seat before you use it to protect your lower parts from contamination.

But dirty toilet seats might not be your biggest concern, given that a 2011 study found that when the toilet is flushed, microbes in descending water droplets quickly settle over quite a wide area - including the toilet lid, door, floor and the toilet paper holder.

To avoid being misted by the toilet contents - which includes your germs and those of previous toilet users - it might be advisable to leave the cubicle immediately after you press the flush button.

And, of course, not everyone washes their hands after a toilet visit. So it's highly likely that the main exit door handle will be contaminated.

To avoid recontaminating your clean hands when you leave a public toilet, use your elbow, coat sleeve or a tissue to open the door.

Now wash your hands

The key to complete protection from toilet associated germs is correct hand washing. Washing your hands thoroughly removes dirt, bacteria and viruses which prevents potentially infectious microbes spreading to other people and objects.

It is recommended that hand washing should involve rubbing soapy water over the hands and fingers for 20 to 30 seconds, including under the fingernails. The friction from the rubbing the hands together loosens debris containing microbes.

But be aware that the public toilet sinks, tap handles, and paper towel dispensers or buttons on hand driers all have a major microbial presence. This is because hands that have just wiped bottoms will press the soap dispenser and turn on a tap.

So it is advisable when hand washing is complete, to leave the tap on while you dry your hands - and then to use a clean paper towel to turn off the water. Or if you are using a hand drier use your elbow to press the activate button.

It also absolutely goes without saying that you do not eat, smoke or drink within a toilet stall. The same goes for using your mobile phone. Research shows up to 75 percent of people use their phones on the toilet.

But given that a US study found mobile phones are up to ten times dirtier than toilet seats - maybe its time to stop worrying about the cleanliness of public loos, and time to start worrying about the cleanliness of your phone.

In the case of the 14-year-old girl, she would have no opportunity to identify her harasser, to seek justice, or even gain an apology for their actions. This will likely leave her feeling powerless, anxious and potentially fearful of future communications by the harasser.

Digital devices have changed us

Digital devices have massively influenced how, when, where and why we communicate with others. For example, it is almost standard practice now for many of us to send a series of digital messages over the course of the day, recounting where you are and what you are doing. It may be to your partner, friend or as social media status updates to whoever is interested, and it could result in 10, 20 or even 50+ digital messages every day.

20 years ago, this form of communication would have been highly unusual, almost impossible to deliver, and likely considered inappropriate behaviour.

The constantly changing ways we use technology to communicate with anyone, anytime and anywhere, has had a huge impact on the lives of parents and their children as they endeavour to navigate the digital age in a safe and healthy way.

Until recently, parents did not even know they had to guide their children in how to manage cyber flashing.

Outdated thinking doesn't help

Some public figures recommend confiscating technology as the only way t>o keep young people safe. Such proposals, however, are unhelpful and unfeasible and based on outdated thinking. The horse has bolted, and technology use has firmly become a central and defining feature of life today.

Smartphone use is >almost ubiquitous for young people (95 percent), and social media is firmly established as their preferred platform for communicating with others. Solutions to keep young people safe need to acknowledge and build this understanding into solutions, rather than dismiss or ignore the realities of their digital lives.

While adults often interpret social media as negatively affecting the relationships young people form, this is not the consensus among teens. Although >27 percent of teens concede that social media has led to more bullying, overall spread of rumours, and less meaningful human interactions, 31 percent consider social media to have a mostly positive influence on their life. Teens emphasise social media makes it easier to communicate with family and friends, to connect with new people, to be self-expressive and to get support from others.

For the most part, however, nearly half (45 percent) of teens say the effect of social media is neither positive nor negative on them; it is just life as they know it.

Can we expect cyber safety to ease?

New online safety risks emerge because of a range of intertwined factors.

Continual technology innovation, our increasingly skilled use of our devices, and more blurring of our online and offline lives mean that new ways to harass and to be harassed will, unfortunately, continue to emerge.

It's not just about the technology, however. Harassment (whether digital or not) also boils down to human values.

The finding is reported in today's online edition of the journal Current Biology.

""This discovery, which identifies a direct dopamine neuron connection to the circadian center, is possibly the first step toward the development of unique drugs, targeting specific neurons, to combat the unpleasant symptoms of jet-lag and shiftwork, as well as several dangerous pathologies,"" said Ali Deniz Guler, a UVA professor of biology and neuroscience who oversaw the study in his lab.

Modern society often places abnormal pressure on the human body -- from shifting time schedules due to air travel, to work cycles that don't conform to natural light, to odd eating times -- and these external conditions create an imbalance in the body's natural cycles, which are evolutionarily synchronized to day and night. These imbalances may contribute to depression, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and even cancer.

""Scientists have been working for decades to help the body's circadian system readily re-synchronize to variable work and eating schedules and flights across multiple time zones,"" Guler said. ""Finding this connection between dopamine-producing neurons and the circadian center allows us to target these neurons with therapies that could potentially provide relief of symptoms for travelers and shift workers particularly, and possibly people with insomnia.""

Sleep disorders and abnormal circadian rhythms affecting the brain and other organs can worsen many pathologies involving aberrant dopamine neurotransmission, Guler said, including Parkinson's disease, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and drug addiction.

""New understanding of dopamine-producing neurons and the connection to the body's biorhythms may go a long way toward treatments to alleviate the harmful effects of these serious pathologies,"" Guler said.

Guler's laboratory specializes in identifying neural circuits that govern biological rhythms in the brain, providing unique therapeutic targets for a range of diseases. Ph.D. candidate Ryan Grippo, Guler's graduate student, led the Current Biology study.

The researchers used two types of mice in their investigation: one normal, the other with dopamine signaling disrupted. By shifting the light schedules of the two groups by six hours, a jet-lag effect, they found that the dopamine-disrupted animals took much longer to resynchronize to the six-hour time shift, indicating feedback between the dopamine neurons and the circadian center.

The findings help to answer long-standing questions about why some people can remember faces easily while others quickly forget someone they've just met.

""The way we move our eyes across a new individual's face affects our ability to recognize that individual later,"" explains Jennifer Heisz, a research fellow at the Rotman Institute at Baycrest and newly appointed assistant professor in the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University.

She co-authored the paper with David Shore, psychology professor at McMaster and psychology graduate student Molly Pottruff.

""Our findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of episodic memory and the differences between the sexes. We discovered that women look more at new faces than men do, which allows them to create a richer and more superior memory,"" Heisz says.

Eye tracking technology was used to monitor where study participants looked -- be it eyes, nose or mouth -- while they were shown a series of randomly selected faces on a computer screen. Each face was assigned a name that participants were asked to remember.

One group was tested over the course of one day, another group tested over the course of four days.

The implications are exciting, she says, because it means anyone can be taught to scan more and potentially have better memory.

""The results open the possibility that changing our eye movement pattern may lead to better memory,"" says Shore. ""Increased scanning may prove to be a simple strategy to improve face memory in the general population, especially for individuals with memory impairment like older adults.""

Now, in a breakthrough",0.0,1,"It's no secret humans are social creatures with beliefs that are, literally, all over the map. What wasn't known was how those beliefs are influenced by our social interactions. Now, in a breakthrough study led by a UC Santa Barbara sociologist, scholars have developed a mathematical model that describes the relationship between belief systems and interpersonal influence, and what happens when underlying beliefs change.

According to the paper's lead author, Noah E. Friedkin, a professor of sociology at UCSB, a belief system in a group -- religious or political, for example -- depends on a set of interlocking beliefs. Known as an opinion dynamics model, it's a collection of attitudes, opinions, certainties or ""cognitive orientation"" towards a person or statement. ""A person's belief on one subject may be dependent on their beliefs in other issues,"" he explained. ""There's an underlying cognitive consistency that links multiple beliefs.""

In the paper, ""Network Science on Belief System Dynamics Under Logic Constraints,"" which appears in the current issue of Science, Friedkin and his co-authors extend that opinion dynamics model to cover belief systems composed of interdependent beliefs. As an example, he noted, religion typically consists of an interlocked set of beliefs. If a person believes in a supreme being, he or she will also believe in the Earth's origin story, the supreme being's rules of worship and so on. Those beliefs are buttressed by people who share them. ""If you know how someone feels about one issue, you can pretty much logically infer, on the basis of belief system structure, that they hold certain positions on other issues.""

The mathematical model described in the paper, Friedkin said, addresses two processes. One is the ""interpersonal influence system"" that helps shape a person's beliefs. The other is what happens when a belief changes, and how it recalibrates a person's beliefs on other, linked issues. ""For example,"" he said, ""if you felt strongly about one thing and I can convince you to change your opinion on it, you would go home and, in an internal process, your brain would reorganize your beliefs that depend on the belief that has been changed.""

The paper uses the Iraq War as an example of how beliefs, or ""logic structures,"" function. It notes three statements that underlay the belief that the U.S. preemptive invasion of Iraq was acceptable. One, Saddam Hussein has a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction; two, Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are real and present dangers to the region; and three, a preemptive invasion of Iraq would be a just war.

A ""high certainty of belief"" in the first statement implied a concomitant certainty in statements two and three, the paper noted, and polling indicated a strong majority of Americans supported the war. However, the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction negated statement one and effectively led to a cascading rejection of statements two and three. ""If you don't accept that first premise, then it's difficult to justify or accept the statement that a preemptive war is justified,"" Friedkin noted. ""The cascade of changes occur on multiple issues, and that cascade has a structure to it, which is the logic structure that links a set of issues or beliefs.""

Looking ahead, Friedkin said this new mathematical model of opinion dynamics could give sociologists the tools to study overlooked complex issues. ""My hope, and the hopes of my collaborators,"" he said, ""is that this will trigger more work on this, because the literature and the opinion dynamics have been focused on single-issue dynamics. We hope this article will trigger research on a more complex form of dynamics in which positions on multiple interdependent issues are being modified by influence network processes, and apply it to a variety of different observable cases.""

The paper was the result of interdisciplinary and international collaboration. The other authors are Anton Proskurnikov, a mechanical engineer at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands; Roberto Tempo, a social control theorist at the National Research Council in Torino, Italy; and Sergei Parsegov, a mechanical engineer at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

""It's an interesting field,"" Friedkin observed, ""because without a mathematical model you simply cannot predict the destinations of the individuals' opinions, where they end up, because these influences play out in a network structure. With both direct and complex indirect interpersonal influences at play, a mathematical model of the dynamical system is required to provide an explanation.""

In the paper, ""Network Science on Belief System Dynamics Under Logic Constraints,"" which appears in the current issue of Science, Friedkin and his co-authors extend that opinion dynamics model to cover belief systems composed of interdependent beliefs. As an example, he noted, religion typically consists of an interlocked set of beliefs. If a person believes in a supreme being, he or she will also believe in the Earth's origin story, the supreme being's rules of worship and so on. Those beliefs are buttressed by people who share them. ""If you know how someone feels about one issue, you can pretty much logically infer, on the basis of belief system structure, that they hold certain positions on other issues.""

The mathematical model described in the paper, Friedkin said, addresses two processes. One is the ""interpersonal influence system"" that helps shape a person's beliefs. The other is what happens when a belief changes, and how it recalibrates a person's beliefs on other, linked issues. ""For example,"" he said, ""if you felt strongly about one thing and I can convince you to change your opinion on it, you would go home and, in an internal process, your brain would reorganize your beliefs that depend on the belief that has been changed.""

The paper uses the Iraq War as an example of how beliefs, or ""logic structures,"" function. It notes three statements that underlay the belief that the U.S. preemptive invasion of Iraq was acceptable. One, Saddam Hussein has a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction; two, Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are real and present dangers to the region; and three, a preemptive invasion of Iraq would be a just war.

A ""high certainty of belief"" in the first statement implied a concomitant certainty in statements two and three, the paper noted, and polling indicated a strong majority of Americans supported the war. However, the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction negated statement one and effectively led to a cascading rejection of statements two and three. ""If you don't accept that first premise, then it's difficult to justify or accept the statement that a preemptive war is justified,"" Friedkin noted. ""The cascade of changes occur on multiple issues, and that cascade has a structure to it, which is the logic structure that links a set of issues or beliefs.""

Looking ahead, Friedkin said this new mathematical model of opinion dynamics could give sociologists the tools to study overlooked complex issues. ""My hope, and the hopes of my collaborators,"" he said, ""is that this will trigger more work on this, because the literature and the opinion dynamics have been focused on single-issue dynamics. We hope this article will trigger research on a more complex form of dynamics in which positions on multiple interdependent issues are being modified by influence network processes, and apply it to a variety of different observable cases.""

The paper was the result of interdisciplinary and international collaboration. The other authors are Anton Proskurnikov, a mechanical engineer at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands; Roberto Tempo, a social control theorist at the National Research Council in Torino, Italy; and Sergei Parsegov, a mechanical engineer at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

""It's an interesting field,"" Friedkin observed, ""because without a mathematical model you simply cannot predict the destinations of the individuals' opinions, where they end up, because these influences play out in a network structure. With both direct and complex indirect interpersonal influences at play, a mathematical model of the dynamical system is required to provide an explanation.""

Researchers from King's College in London recently conducted a study, published in Environmental International journal, to determine the different micropollutants that might contaminate wildlife, including freshwater shrimp.

To do so, they collected samples from five catchment areas and 15 different sites across the county of Suffolk.

After analyzing the results, they found cocaine and other contaminates, such as ketamine, pesticides and pharmaceuticals, in the shrimp they tested.

""Although concentrations were low, we were able to identify compounds that might be of concern to the environment and crucially, which might pose a risk to wildlife,"" lead author Thomas Miller said in a statement. ""As part of our ongoing work, we found that the most frequently detected compounds were illicit drugs, including cocaine and ketamine and a banned pesticide, fenuron.

These scientists, led by Sampsa Hautaniemi, PhD, professor of systems biology, reported that they were able to use ctDNA shed by ovarian tumors to identify clinically actionable mutations.

In addition, the group analyzed 78 circulating tumor DNA samples from 12 ovarian cancer patients before, during, and after the treatment. The data the researchers collected were analyzed using an open-access ctDNA-tailored bioinformatics analysis pipeline and in-house Translational Oncology Knowledgebase to detect clinically actionable genomic alterations.

The results of this work appeared May 3 in JCO Precision Oncology, in an article titled, ""Prospective Longitudinal ctDNA Workflow Reveals Clinically Actionable Alterations in Ovarian Cancer.""

""Our results show good concordance of mutations and copy number alterations in ctDNA and tumor samples, and alterations associated with clinically available drugs were detected in seven patients (58%),"" the article's authors indicated.

The current study focused on high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common and aggressive form of epithelial ovarian cancer. Over half of the patients diagnosed with HGSOC die within five years of diagnosis, that is, annually more than 150,000 women globally.

HGSOC tumors consist of several heterogeneous cell populations with a large number of mutations. This genetic variability makes it difficult to find drugs that would kill all the cancer cells, and to which the cells would not become resistant during treatment. To improve the efficacy of HGSOC treatment, the current study evaluated whether ctDNA, as a precision medicine modality, could be used to select the best available treatment.

""Analyzing ctDNA enables us to detect genomic alterations [not only in early-stage cancers, but] also in late-stage cancers, [when] taking biopsies from the tumor is difficult or even impossible,"" said Hautaniemi.

In the newly published article, the authors assert that its proof-of-concept study demonstrates that ctDNA can guide clinical decisions. Furthermore, the researchers say their results show that longitudinal ctDNA samples can be used to identify poor-responding patients after first cycles of chemotherapy. Finally, the researchers maintain that they have provided the first comprehensive, open-source circulating tumor DNA workflow for detecting clinically actionable alterations in solid cancers.

""The prognosis of ovarian cancer patients is still poor,"" Hautaniemi pointed out.

Yet scientists have puzzled for years over exactly why that is. Now, resear",0.75,1,"Multicellular organisms have evolved the almost universal trait of using single cells, such as eggs and sperm, to reproduce. Yet scientists have puzzled for years over exactly why that is. Now, researchers have taken a closer look at this evolutionary trait and have set a big piece of that puzzle into place by applying experimental evolution to transform a single-celled algae into a multicellular one that reproduces by dispersing single cells.

The algae was produced when researchers repeatedly selected and cultured algae that settled quickly to the bottom of a liquid-filled test tube. After about 73 rounds, the scientists discovered that the algae in one of the tubes had become multicellular.

""Until now, biologists have assumed that this single-cell bottleneck evolved well after multicellularity, as a mechanism to reduce conflicts of interest among the cells making up the organism,"" said William Ratcliff, one of the researchers, in a news release. ""Instead, we found that it arose at the same time as multicellularity. This has big implications for how multicellular complexity might arise in nature, because it shows that this key trait, which opens the door to evolving great multicellular complexity, can evolve rapidly.""

After watching the new form of algae, the researchers found that it reproduced by actively breaking up and shedding motile single cells that went on to grow into new multicellular clusters. The scientists then developed a mathematical model that explained the reproductive benefit of this single-celled strategy over hypothetical alternatives in which the cluster would produce larger propagules. This model predicted that reproduction from single cells would be more successful in the long run.

""Understanding the origins of biological complexity is one of the biggest challenges in science,"" said Michael Travisano, one of the researchers, in a news release. ""In this experiment, we've reordered one of the first steps in the origin of multicellularity, showing that two key evolutionary steps can occur far faster than previously anticipated. Looking forward, we hope to directly investigate the origins fo developmental complexity, or how juveniles become adults, using the multicellular organisms that we evolved in the lab.""

The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.",4,1.0,0,0.0,The Origin of Biological Complexity: The Evolution of Single Cells,"Multicellular organisms have evolved the almost universal trait of using single cells, such as eggs and sperm, to reproduce. Yet scientists have puzzled for years over exactly why that is. Now, researchers have taken a closer look at this evolutionary trait and have set a big piece of that puzzle into place by applying experimental evolution to transform a single-celled algae into a multicellular one that reproduces by dispersing single cells.

The algae was produced when researchers repeatedly selected and cultured algae that settled quickly to the bottom of a liquid-filled test tube. After about 73 rounds, the scientists discovered that the algae in one of the tubes had become multicellular.

""Until now, biologists have assumed that this single-cell bottleneck evolved well after multicellularity, as a mechanism to reduce conflicts of interest among the cells making up the organism,"" said William Ratcliff, one of the researchers, in a news release. ""Instead, we found that it arose at the same time as multicellularity. This has big implications for how multicellular complexity might arise in nature, because it shows that this key trait, which opens the door to evolving great multicellular complexity, can evolve rapidly.""

After watching the new form of algae, the researchers found that it reproduced by actively breaking up and shedding motile single cells that went on to grow into new multicellular clusters.

Cozy coddling or exhilarating exploration

In my latest book, ""Coding as a Playground,"" I invite readers to recall the playground of their childhood. Children were able to run, to explore, to invent new games, to engage in pretend play; to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve with others; and to make their own choices.

Now, think of a playpen. These safe, confined spaces are in stark contrast with playgrounds. The playpen conveys a lack of freedom to experiment, lack of autonomy for exploration, lack of creative opportunities and lack of risks. It's a place where a child can be stowed to pass the time.

While playgrounds are open-ended, playpens are limited. The playground promotes while the playpen hindersimportant aspects of human development.

Unfortunately, from a developmental perspective, many of today's technologies for young children are playpens and not playgrounds.

Of course, computer games, like playpens, deprive children of physical activity. But the metaphor goes further than that. Some computer games are marketed as educational because they promote academic skills and teach about shapes, colors, letters, sounds and numbers. Most software provides tasks with right and wrong answers and thus doesn't encourage problem solving and logical thinking or exploration and creativity. Most robots provide prepackaged challenges for children to complete, and in the process, learn to code. These are all examples of high-tech playpens - they're limited and do not tap into many important dimensions of healthy positive development in children.

Six C's to look for

Over two decades of research, I've developed a theoretical framework called Positive Technological Development to guide parents, educators and researchers in distinguishing high-tech playgrounds from playpens.

This framework focuses on six positive behaviors that can be promoted through the use of technological playgrounds. These behaviors involve:

content creation

creativity

choices of conduct

communication

collaboration

community building

These six C's can be fostered in real-world playgrounds and can also be supported by robotic platforms, virtual worlds, programming languages, apps, games and storytelling systems for children.

But it's not enough to read the label on the box. It's important to understand the kind of experiences children will have when interacting with the technology.

These six C's can be fostered in real-world playgrounds and can also be supported by robotic platforms, virtual worlds, programming languages, apps, games and storytelling systems for children.

But it's not enough to read the label on the box. It's important to understand the kind of experiences children will have when interacting with the technology.

Search out technologies that engage children as producers, not consumers. That means robotic kits, apps or computer games that let them be makers, artists, coders and designers. Try to avoid prepackaged solutions that target a specific skill set and promise to help children improve their academics. Remember that technological playgrounds need to also be fun!

At the DevTech research group that I direct at Tufts University, we focus on a particular kind of technological playground: programming environments for young children between 4 and 7 years old. Our research shows that by learning how to code, children take on the role of producers and not merely consumers. They're able to engage with all six C's.

For example, we created the free ScratchJr coding app, in collaboration with Mitch Resnick at the MIT Media Lab. ScratchJr is a playground in that it promotes problem-solving, imagination, cognitive challenges, social interactions, motor skills development, emotional exploration and making different choices. Crucially, we make explicit the connection between the activity of coding and the playfulness of the experience.

At the playground, children can visit the sandbox, the swing or the slide, or just run around. Similarly, you want to find tech toys that let children engage in lots of different creative and expressive activities. For example, beyond coding, an app might let them create and modify characters and record and play their own voices and sounds. A playpen, instead, might let them move up across levels only when they solve a particular problem or select the right number or letter.

Caregivers don't exclusively take children to the playground. There are other places to visit and other skills to develop. But, when getting new technologies for young children, you're looking for a tech playground and not a playpen.

Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in traumatic injuries, ranking fourth in the United States at a total cost of $671 billion in 2013. Working with an interdisciplinary team involving collaborators from Assiut University in Egypt, Texas A&M chemist Karen Wooley's research group has developed a bioabsorbable wound dressing that builds on the already proven blood-flow-staunching properties of chitosan - a natural material widely used in commercial wound dressings - by taking them nanoscale to boost their effectiveness and impact.

Wooley's team, led by Texas A&M chemistry Ph.D. student and NASA Space Technology Research Fellow Eric Leonhardt, successfully encapsulated highly entangled nanofibers of chitosan within a sugar-based hydrogel that dissolves in as little as seven days, leaving behind a significantly larger available wound-healing surface while eliminating the need for subsequent physical removal.

Their results are published in Nature Communications (""Absorbable hemostatic hydrogels comprising composites of sacrificial templates and honeycomb-like nanofibrous mats of chitosan"").

""Bioabsorbable wound dressings that can be applied and left in the injury site are desirable for a variety of blood loss scenarios -- for example, to control bleeding in traumatic injuries and to save lives on both civilian and military fronts,"" said Leonhardt, who served as first author on the team's paper. ""The composite materials we've developed are malleable and could be easily administered to wound sites. They have also performed significantly better in terms of reducing the amount of blood loss and the time required to achieve hemostasis against commercially available bioabsorbable wound dressing in several animal models.""

Team members in addition to Leonhardt include Texas A&M materials science and engineering Ph.D. student Nari Kang; Dr. Mahmoud Elsabahy, assistant director of the Texas A&M Laboratory for Synthetic-Biologic Interactions and director of the Assiut Clinical Center of Nanomedicine at Al-Rajhy Liver Hospital; and Dr. Mostafa A. Hamad, a professor in the Department of Surgery within the Assuit Faculty of Medicine.

Elsabahy recognized that, while chitosan is a desirable option in such dressings due to its proven efficacy in slowing blood flow and because it offers bonus antimicrobial properties, it also has a tendency to clump, rendering it difficult to incorporate into a bioabsorbable material. The team overcame that obstacle by loading chitosan into a nanostructured template scaffold to better disperse it and increase its interaction with blood components, thereby speeding up both absorption and healing.

As a first step in their breakthrough discovery process, the researchers developed hydrogels from cyclodextrins - a type of saccharide with hydrolytically degradable linkages - designed with sites that were capable of ionically interacting with and binding to chitosan molecules. After freeze-drying the resulting composite material, they exposed it to a solution that removed the template scaffold. They then used scanning electron microscopy to further analyze the chitosan, which they determined had assembled into mats of highly entangled nanofibers measuring about 10-to-20 nanometers in diameter.

""Not only are these fibers considerably smaller than what has been previously reported for chitosan, they also are highly desirable, given that the corresponding increase in surface area is expected to greatly enhance hemostatic effect,"" said Elsabahy, who conceived the project. ""We believe this work will enhance the scope of chitosan as a hemostatic technology through the demonstration of its fabrication and use as a bioabsorbable wound dressing.""

To date, the team has applied their composite wound dressings to liver injuries in rats, rabbits and pigs, measuring the amount of blood loss, time to hemostasis and mean arterial pressure in each case to gauge effectiveness. The dressings also were implanted in the liver and imaged after seven days to evaluate the biodegradation of the composite materials. No residues could be observed in any of the settings.

""Hemorrhage is responsible for more than 35 percent of pre-hospital deaths and more than 40 percent of deaths within the first 24 hours of injury,"" Leonhardt said. ""Hemostatic dressings have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality through the early control of hemorrhage. These dressings can be included in first aid kits and carried by soldiers to save lives in the battlefield, and they can be also utilized to control bleeding in various injury scenarios and surgical procedures in hospitals. Absorbable hemostatic dressing can be left in the injury site and eliminate the necessity for carrier removal, which reduces the risk of re-bleeding -- in case of carrier removal of non-absorbable dressings -- and decreases the duration required for the surgical interventions.""",2,0.25,0,0.0,Chemists develop nanoscale bioabsorbable wound dressing,"Chemists develop nanoscale bioabsorbable wound dressing (Nanowerk News) Scientists at Texas A&M University are harnessing the combined power of organic nanomaterials-based chemistry and a natural product found in crustacean exoskeletons to help bring emergency medicine one step closer to a viable solution for mitigating blood loss, from the hospital to the battlefield.

Caffeine and related chemical compounds have become significant water pollutants due to widespread use in coffee, soft drinks, tea, energy drinks, chocolate and certain medications, they said, and a bacterium that could live solely on caffeine could be used to clean up such environmental contamination.

So Jeffrey E. Barrick of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues set out to genetically engineer just such a bacterium.

Scientists have known a natural soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida CBB5, can survive just on caffeine, so Barrick's team set out to transfer it genetic ability to metabolize caffeine into E. coli, a biotechnology workhorse that is easy to handle and grow.

The result was bacteria literally addicted to caffeine, the researchers said, which could have applications beyond environmental remediation.

It could also find use as a sensor to measure caffeine levels in beverages, in recovery of nutrient-rich byproducts of coffee processing and for the cost-effective bioproduction of medicines, they said.

A suitor was placed on a wooden peg linked by silk strands to the webs of two prospective paramours. Males used pheromones on the silk to detect how many previous partners the females had, and chose those with only one former lover 75% to 90% of the time over females that had mated twice. When deciding between two females that had mated once, however, males couldn't distinguish which genital opening was available based on pheromones alone, meaning their ""spidey sense"" had its limits. In a third experiment, virgin males with two palps were presented with a virgin female, but interestingly, they never mated twice, opting to save a palp for a future mistress.

News provided byMar 26, 2018, 08:00 ETShare this articleENCINITAS, Calif., March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CycloPure, Inc., a developer of next-generation water purification adsorbents, announced today that the National Institutes of Health has awarded the company a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I grant in the amount of $149,000. The company will use the funds to accelerate development of its CD-PFAS High-Affinity Cyclodextrin Polymer (HACP) adsorbent that safely removes hazardous perfluorinated (PFAS) compounds in drinking water and waste water treatment applications.Contamination of drinking water by PFAS compounds such as PFOA and PFOS represent major health threats because of their link to multiple cancers, endocrine system disorders, and thyroid disease. Recent studies estimate that drinking water systems which serve tens of millions of Americans currently contain high concentrations of these contaminants resulting in communities across several states advising residents to avoid using tap water for drinking and cooking purposes. ""We are pleased to receive this award from the National Institutes of Health,"" said CycloPure co-founder and Chief Science Officer Will Dichtel. ""It attests to our technology's promise to deliver important health benefits in water treatment by sequestering heavily fluorinated organic pollutants that often pass through water treatment systems into the public's drinking water."" CycloPure's fluorine-selective CD-PFAS polymer was first profiled in a 2017 study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, reporting on the polymer's superior performance in the removal of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) compared to activated carbon which is the most commonly used adsorbent in water treatment applications.1 ""CD-PFAS has more than ten-fold higher affinity to PFAS compounds compared to activated carbon, which allows for lower dosing requirements to achieve non-detect or advisory limit removal,"" Dichtel added. ""Importantly, our CD-PFAS adsorbent is made in a single-step process using cyclodextrin, a readily available sugar molecule derived from sustainable corn starch.""""We've made a lot of progress with our CD-PFAS polymer in field trials over the past 12 months and have demonstrated its superior performance to activated carbon under various conditions including simulated groundwater, AFFF solution, and contaminated well water,"" said Frank Cassou, CycloPure CEO. ""The NIH funding will help accelerate our development activities and bring us closer to making our technology commercially available to help communities remove toxic PFAS compounds from their drinking water.""Making Water Safe - About CycloPureFounded in 2016, CycloPure is a materials science and technology company that is commercializing a new class of selective adsorbents called High-Affinity Cyclodextrin Polymers (HACPs). The company's pioneering technology allows the conversion of renewable cyclodextrins (derived from corn starch) into highly adsorbent materials ideally suited for water treatment applications.Government and other studies have shown that trace contaminants (measured in parts per billion and less), including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and pharmaceutical residues, are pervasive in water and can retain toxic effect at low concentration. Using its novel polymer technology, CycloPure has developed two novel adsorbent formulations, CD-MP and CD-PFAS, for the removal of harmful contaminants from water, including the perfluorinated compounds PFOA and PFOS. CycloPure's patented HACPs can be produced in varying particle sizes, tailored to filtration and water flow requirements, allowing for flexible use across a broad spectrum of water purification applications. CycloPure is working with global partners to produce and distribute its proprietary HACPs to meet growing worldwide interest from water treatment managers, food and beverage companies, government agencies, and manufacturers of point-of-use consumer water purification products.

In the quest to realize artificial photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into fuel - just as plants do - researchers need to not only identify materials to efficiently perform photoelectrochemical water splitting, but also to understand why a certain material may or may not work. Now scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have pioneered a technique that uses nanoscale imaging to understand how local, nanoscale properties can affect a material's macroscopic performance.

Their study, ""Nanoscale Imaging of Charge Carrier Transport in Water Splitting Anodes,"" has just been published. The lead researchers were Johanna Eichhorn and Francesca Toma of Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division.

""This technique correlates the material's morphology to its functionality, and gives insights on the charge transport mechanism, or how the charges move inside the material, at the nanoscale,"" said Toma, who is also a researcher in the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis , a Department of Energy Innovation Hub.

Artificial photosynthesis seeks to produce energy-dense fuel using only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide as inputs. The advantage of such an approach is that it does not compete against food stocks and would produce no or low greenhouse gas emissions. A photoelectrochemical water splitting system requires specialized semiconductors that use sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

Bismuth vanadate has been identified as a promising material for a photoanode, which provides charges to oxidize water in a photoelectrochemical cell. ""This material is a case example in which efficiency should be theoretically good, but in experimental tests you actually observe very poor efficiency,"" Eichhorn said. ""The reasons for that are not completely understood.""

The researchers used photoconductive atomic force microscopy to map the current at every point of the sample with high spatial resolution. This technique has already been used to analyze local charge transport and optoelectronic properties of solar cell materials but is not known to have been used to understand the charge carrier transport limitations at the nanoscale in photoelectrochemical materials.

Eichhorn and Toma worked with scientists at the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscale science research facility at Berkeley Lab, on these measurements through the Foundry's user program. They found that there were differences in performance related to the nanoscale morphology of the material.

""We discovered that the way charges are utilized is not homogeneous over the whole sample, but rather, there's heterogeneity,"" Eichhorn said. ""Those differences in performance may account for its macroscopic performance - the overall output of the sample - when we perform water splitting.""

To understand this characterization, Toma gives the example of a solar panel. ""Let's say the panel has 22 percent efficiency,"" she said. ""But can you tell at the nanoscale, at each point in the panel, that it will give you 22 percent efficiency? This technique enables you to say, yes or no, specifically for photoelectrochemical materials. If the answer is no, it means there are less active spots on your material. In the best case it just decreases your total efficiency, but if there are more complex processes, your efficiency can be decreased by a lot.""

The improved understanding of how the bismuth vanadate is working will also allow researchers to synthesize new materials that may be able to drive the same reaction more efficiently. This study builds on previous research by Toma and others , in which she was able to analyze and predict the mechanism that defines (photo)chemical stability of a photoelectrochemical material.

Toma said these results put scientists much closer to achieving efficient artificial photosynthesis. ""Now we know how to measure local photocurrent in these materials, which have very low conductivity,"" she said. ""The next step is to put all of this in a liquid electrolyte and do exactly the same thing. We have the tools. Now we know how to interpret the results, and how to analyze them, which is an important first step for moving forward.""

Other co-authors of the study were Christoph Kastl, Jason Cooper, Adam Schwartzberg, and Ian Sharp (now at the Technical University of Munich) of Berkeley Lab; and Dominik Ziegler of Scuba Probe Technologies, a startup company and Molecular Foundry user.

binx io enables first-ever ""test-and-treat"" paradigm with sample to answer in 30 minutes for the two most tested-for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)News provided byAug 12, 2019, 08:30 ETShare this articleBOSTON, Aug. 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --  binx health, the pioneer in anywhere, anytime testing for women's health, today announced that it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its first-of-kind, highly sensitive and specific, molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing platform, the binx io(r).  The binx io platform is a rapid, qualitative, fully-automated test, designed to be easy to use, and intended for use in POC or clinical laboratory settings, providing the world's first sample-to-answer result in about 30 minutes for the detection of chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (NG)--the two most tested-for STIs globally. In the Company's recently completed 1,523-person, multi-center clinical study, 96% of patient samples were processed on the binx io by non-laboratorians in a POC setting. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) all recommend annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screening for millions of women in the United States. Standard of care today for CT/NG testing typically involves lengthy wait times from sample to result (often up to seven-day turnaround times), with up to 40%1 of positive patients not returning for treatment once they leave a physician's office.""Today we announced a significant health milestone toward making STI testing rapid and convenient with a platform profile and performance levels with the potential to vastly improve health outcomes for millions of women in the United States,"" said Jeff Luber, President and CEO of binx health. ""With the 'front door' of healthcare increasingly moving to near-patient settings, today's FDA clearance puts the power of rapid onsite care where consumers need it most--in the communities where they live, work and shop.""STIs have been rising dramatically and are a growing global public health crisis.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates more than one million STIs are acquired every day2, and recently remarked on the rise in STIs as ""a hidden epidemic, a silent epidemic, a dangerous epidemic,"" stating the growing rate of infection should be ""'a wake-up call' for authorities to ""ensure that everybody had access to services to prevent and treat STIs"".  In the United States, the CDC has reported that only 12%3 of people aged 15-25 who should be screened annually have been screened for STIs, despite their carrying 50% of the annual infection burden. In women, undetected STIs can lead to a host of reproductive health problems, including infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and other co-morbidities that can often be avoided through early, rapid detection in near-patient settings.PLATFORM DETAILSThe binx io is a robust and easy to use diagnostic platform, has the ability to multiplex up to 24 targets, and requires no calibration or maintenance.  The platform consists of a small, benchtop instrument and single-use, assay-specific cartridge that can process an unprocessed patient sample with no user interaction once the sample is added to the cartridge. The cartridge contains all reagents needed for the assay and uses PCR amplification and binx' proprietary electrochemical detection technology to provide rapid and accurate results.  The io has been cleared for use in point-of-care or clinical laboratory settings for the detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea in female vaginal swab samples collected either by a clinician or self-collected by a patient in a clinical setting. ""The binx io platform is elegant in design and powerful in detection ability,"" said Dr. Anna Dixon, the company's Chief Technology Officer. ""Having achieved clearance for CT/NG and with this strong predicate now in place, we're excited to now move our other robust sexual wellness assays toward regulatory filing."" CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTSIn a recent multi-center clinical trial encompassing 17 evaluation centers and more than 1,500 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the binx io was demonstrated to be an accurate and reliable test platform when compared to the current central lab standard of care systems for two of the most common STIs, chlamydia and gonorrhea, in women. Clinical study performance showed a 96.1% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity for chlamydia and 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity for gonorrhea testing in women tested.""Our experience testing the binx io system revealed a potentially major paradigm shift in the process of addressing STIs,"" said Dr. Barbara Van Der Pol, president of the American STD Association, director of a diagnostic lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. ""During a recent evaluation4, we found that a high proportion of patients were willing to wait when presented with the possibility of rapid results, suggesting that test-and-treat in the same visit is possible for the first time.""CLINICAL GUIDELINESCDC, USPSTF and ACOG all recommend annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually-active women under age 25, for all pregnant women under age 24, and in older women at increased risk of infection.5,6,7 CDC also recommends retesting three months after treatment8.  ACOG and CDC further recommend that chlamydia and gonorrhea testing be conducted using nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) on vaginal swab--the technical approach and sample type for which the binx io was cleared by the FDA.9ABOUT BINX HEALTHbinx health(tm) is the pioneer in anywhere care in women's health for consumers where they live, work and shop.

A new study revealed that different vertebrate species in the eastern United States have responded to the effects of climate change over the last 500,000 years differently.

The study, published in the journal Ecology Letters, suggests that the animal populations during the expansion and contraction of massive glaciers across the region have been affected in different ways and different times.

""We need to move beyond viewing communities as single units,"" explained Brian T. Smith, an assistant curator in the American Museum of Natural History's Department of Ornithology and co-author of the study, in a press release. ""Some species will respond in one way and others will respond in other ways. And there are many external historical, biological, and stochastic factors that will influence how populations respond to global warming.""

For the study, the researchers analyzed the genomes of tetrapods, such as snakes, lizards, mammals, birds, turtles and frogs. By focusing the on the historical population sizes of tetrapods, the researchers were able to model the likelihood of the populations to grow or shrink as response to climate change.

The researchers noted that increase in genetic differences among the population signals an expansion in their population, while lesser genetic differences mean smaller populations. Previous theory suggests that local populations of animals will ""synchronously"" as the glacier recedes.

However, the researchers did not find any evidence that different animal populations have similar response to the changing climate. About 25 percent of the populations experience negative response to the climate change. These populations felt a dramatic decline in their numbers. On the other, about 75 percent of the animals went through a population expansion. Out of those expanding lineages, only 50 percent expanded together.

With their findings, the researchers warned the scientist not to view certain animal population communities as a single synchronized unit. The researchers noted that the contracting and expanding of a huge glacier could affect everyone. However, different animal population may have different response to such events.

Prior to the study, leading theories argued that locally produced agricultural resources must have been vital in feeding and maintaining the substantial occupying army, though this idea was based on very limited evidence.

Using strontium isotope analysis to analyse the bones of domestic animals from the fortress, the researchers identified a mix of sources. Significantly, the diverse pattern of results does not suggest a centralised supply chain from near or far - results that challenge existing theories.

While the majority of livestock are consistent with origins in the local area, analysis found that at least one quarter of the pigs, cattle and caprines (sheep/goats) originated outside southeast Wales, some from southern or eastern England while others could have come from as far away as southern Scotland or northern France.

Senior Lecturer in Roman Archaeology Dr Peter Guest, who led the latest discoveries at Caerleon - Britain's only undisturbed Roman legionary fortress, said: ""Provisioning large concentrations of professional soldiers in Britain after the invasion in AD 43 was a major challenge for the Roman Empire. For the first time we can see that the invaders were sourcing livestock both locally and from considerable distances. How these supply networks operated remains unclear, but this study has important implications not only for understanding how the Roman army was sustained in Britannia but also the impact that provisioning the army had on the countryside, particularly around military sites.""

Should physicians give the information to them? Some bioethicists believe that such testing is wrong, arguing that such information could stigmatize the child and that it may suggest that people with genetic illness predispositions should never have been born. They further argue that children have a right to an ""open future"" in which they are not burdened with the knowledge of their genetic predispositions for adult onset illnesses.

Consider the situation of Amanda and Bradley Kalinsky, as reported on the front page of The New York Times. Amanda Kalinsky tested positive for the gene that produces Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, a form of early onset dementia. Several family members, including her father, had already succumbed to the disease. When she found out that she was a carrier, she initially vowed never to have children. Amanda and her husband learned, however, that they could use pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of their embryos to avoid passing along the gene to their kids. Fertility clinic specialists induced her to produce several eggs that were removed and then fertilized with her husband's sperm. The resulting embryos were tested for the GSS gene, and only those which did not have it were implanted her womb. The happy result is that the Kalinskys are the parents of three children that have been spared the prospect of suffering the disease that is likely to kill their mother.

In the Times article, the Yeshiva University bioethicist David Wasserman argues that discarding embryos with that carry deleterious adult onset disease genes is essentially saying that someone like Amanda Kalinsky should never have been born. But decisions about who should be born ought not to be in the hands of ethicists; they should be left up to the people whose lives and values are actually on the line. For Kalinsky, the fact that any of the children she might bear through conventional reproduction could inherit the deleterious GSS gene was a bad enough possible outcome for her to decide never to reproduce. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis enabled her and her husband to have children like her but without the prospect of suffering the disease. Either way, the child with the GSS gene was not going to be born; this way, someone still got to be born anyway.

The Kalinskys knew exactly what heritable disease they wanted their prospective children to avoid. Now a new, much more comprehensive whole genome screening test enables researchers and physicians to identify disease risks in developing fetuses that parents might not be aware of, such as genes increasing the possibility of breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease. The new test sequences a fetus' genome based on DNA it sheds into its mother's bloodstream. So researchers can now reveal genetic predispositions ranging from trivial characteristics like hair and eye color and propensity to baldness to the risk of diabetes and cancer.

Is it ethical for physicians to sequence a fetus' genome and then tell parents what the genetic screening test uncovers? Yes, argues Ignatia B. Van den Veyver of Baylor College in the current issue of Prenatal Diagnosis. Among other arguments, Van den Veyver correctly notes that withholding prenatal genetic testing information thwarts the autonomy of parents to make reproductive decisions. With regard to whether such genetic knowledge impair a child's right to an open future, Van den Veyver ponders ""whether we infringe autonomy by shielding information that may allow parents and young adults to make decisions about their future that take into consideration all aspects of their current or future health.""

Similarly, in the January 16 New England Journal of Medicine, Ilana Yurkiewicz of Harvard Medical School, Lisa Soleymani Lehmann of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Bruce Korf of the University of Alabama at Birmingham argue that it is ethical to provide parents with prenatal whole genome sequencing information about their prospective children. They write that it is ""a basic right of reproductive choice and parental autonomy; people may choose when, with whom, and how to reproduce, and they have the right to data that may inform these decisions."" The trio also notes that women in the United States do not have to provide a reason for obtaining an abortion, so it is ""difficult to justify restricting abortion in the case of a well-defined reason, such as genetic disease.""

They also reject the notion that genetic ignorance is somehow liberating. ""Instead of limiting a child's potential future, knowledge of genetic risks can offer a greater opportunity to inform possibilities for a good life,"" they point out. And that's the essential point: Whatever some bioethicists might believe, autonomy is never enhanced by ignorance.",13,4.333333333333333,1,0.3333333333333333,Should Parents Be Allowed To Know Their Fetus Will Get Alzheimer’s?,"Should prospective parents seek information about gene variants that increase the risk that their children will develop diseases that manifest themselves when they are adults?

Gender inequality is linked to more deaths than expected among girl",0.23529411764705882,1,"In countries where women face more unequal treatment in society, young girls have a lower chance of survival, a new analysis finds.

Gender inequality is linked to more deaths than expected among girls under the age of 5 compared with boys of the same age, especially in lower- and middle-income countries, says the study, published Tuesday.

Children Deaths and fatalities Demographic groups Discrimination Families and children Family members and relatives Gender equality Health and medical Population and demographics Public health Sex and gender issues Sex discrimination Societal issues Society Parents and parenting Death rates Employment and income status Labor and employment Low income persons Population trends Social and economic status

Girls have a statistic, perhaps evolutionary, advantage over to boys when it comes to survival. This seems to exist through women's childbearing ages, said lead researcher Valentina Gallo, professor of epidemiology at Queen Mary University of London's Centre for Primary Care and Public Health.

But the study shows that in settings in which sexist attitudes value boys more than girls, this advantage is reduced and a greater proportion of girls are dying, fueled by reduced access to basic health care and more exposure to health risks, such as female genital mutilation. In India, for example, the rates of vaccinating girls are lower than in boys.

The team analyzed gender inequality levels and sex-specific child mortality rates in 195 countries using UNICEF's database of child mortality worldwide and the UN's Gender Inequality Index, which measures gender inequality based on reproductive health, female empowerment and economic status.

""These girls are also further exposed to this risk via their mothers, who may themselves be penalized and valued less than mothers of sons and less able to provide for their daughters,"" Gallo said.

Using statistical models, the team explored the association between a country's male to female ratio of under-5 child mortality rates -- which shows the probability of deaths per 1,000 live births by sex -- and gender inequality. They found a strong correlation between low levels of equality and more young girls dying than they should, Gallo said.

But other experts warn against claiming causation from such correlations and say more research is needed.

Research has shown that countries with higher infant mortality also experienced more gender discrimination, but this study is the first to examine how this impacts girls and boys separately.

""We are not sure we can generalize these findings. However, at [a] country level, the highest gender inequality led to more girls dying,"" Gallo said.

Removing an evolutionary advantage

Worldwide, more boys are dying than girls, but low to middle-income countries were found to have a smaller difference -- a lower male to female child mortality ratio -- meaning that more girls are dying. This in turn correlated with the countries that had greater gender inequality.

Sarah Hawkes, professor of global public health at University College London and director of the university's Centre for Gender and Global Health, says this advantage has been known since the 17th century.

""The study highlights a few things we have been pushing for in global health research and policies for some time now,"" said Hawkes, who was not involved in the study.

It is not possible to estimate a natural or ideal rate for the male to female child mortality ratio, Gallo said, but this study found that the ratio varies from 0.8 to 1.4, with a majority of countries having a rate of 1.2, equaling 120 boys dying for every 100 girls.

The higher the gender inequality index, the lower the sex ratio for children under the age of 5 dying. This means that in the world's least-gender-equal societies -- like Yemen, which scored the lowest score out of the 195 countries -- more girls than expected were dying than boys under the age of 5.

India and Tonga are outliers, as their male to female ratio is less than one, so more girls than boys are dying in total, Gallo explained. ""There is clearly a problem."" Both countries ranked among the lowest for gender equality, with Tonga in the bottom 10.

""It is surprising that [gender inequality] is so strongly associated with mortality. There is something going on that makes girls severely more discriminated than boys in many regions in the world,"" Gallo said.

'Can't infer causation from correlations'

The study is a snapshot of gender in the countries examined, but ""health statistics 101 will tell you, you can't infer causation from correlations,"" Hawkes warned. Gallo's team also stressed the need for more research so definitive causal links can be drawn between gender and mortality for under five.

The paper's authors also note that many studies point toward lower-income countries reporting disproportionately fewer female deaths, with families being less likely to record female deaths.

Alexandra Rolland, sexual and reproductive health and rights policy adviser for the charity Plan International, mentioned that the data collected could be incomplete, meaning the actual picture of young girls dying could be worse than the study is demonstrating. ""We know that there are a lot of children who's birth isn't registered,"" Rolland added.

In these countries, it is important to note that parents don't love their daughters less, she explained. ""It means that [their] limited income will be spent toward boys,"" rather than girls.

Hawkes highlighted that this study fits into a growing body of evidence that gender is a large determinant of health across all ages and needs to be taken seriously in policy responses. ""Data captures sex,"" Hawkes said. ""But gender is about what it means to be a boy or a girl in any society.""

In 2015, 5.9 million children around the globe died before they turned 5. Some of the factors for these young deaths, besides gender, are being born in rural areas, in poor households or to mothers denied basic education. Rolland stresses that the numbers talk about human beings ""whose lives are completely unnecessarily cut short.""

The paper's authors noted that their analysis should show the need to address gender inequality not only in terms of health but in the field of women's political empowerment, participation in the workforce and education.

Pesky mosquitoes, disease-carrying ticks, crop-munching aphids and cockroaches are doing ju",0.36,1,"A staple of summer -- swarms of bugs -- seems to be a thing of the past. And that's got scientists worried.

Pesky mosquitoes, disease-carrying ticks, crop-munching aphids and cockroaches are doing just fine. But the more beneficial flying insects of summer -- native bees, moths, butterflies, ladybugs, lovebugs, mayflies and fireflies -- appear to be less abundant.

Scientists think something is amiss, but they can't be certain: In the past, they didn't systematically count the population of flying insects, so they can't make a proper comparison to today. Nevertheless, they're pretty sure across the globe there are fewer insects that are crucial to as much as 80 percent of what we eat.

Yes, some insects are pests. But they also pollinate plants, are a key link in the food chain and help decompose life.

""You have total ecosystem collapse if you lose your insects. How much worse can it get than that?"" said University of Delaware entomologist Doug Tallamy. If they disappeared, ""the world would start to rot.""

He noted Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson once called bugs: ""The little things that run the world.""

The 89-year-old Wilson recalled that he once frolicked in a ""Washington alive with insects, especially butterflies."" Now, ""the flying insects are virtually gone.""

It hit home last year when he drove from suburban Boston to Vermont and decided to count how many bugs hit his windshield. The result: A single moth.

WINDSHIELD TEST

The un-scientific experiment is called the windshield test. Wilson recommends everyday people do it themselves to see. Baby Boomers will probably notice the difference, Tallamy said.

Several scientists have conducted their own tests with windshields, car grilles and headlights, and most notice few squashed bugs. Researchers are quick to point out that such exercises aren't good scientific experiments, since they don't include control groups or make comparisons with past results. (Today's cars also are more aerodynamic, so bugs are more likely to slip past them and live to buzz about it.)

Still, there are signs of decline. Research has shown dwindling individual species in specific places, including lightning bugs, moths and bumblebees. One study estimated a 14 percent decline in ladybugs in the United States and Canada from 1987 to 2006. University of Florida urban entomologist Philip Koehler said he's seen a recent decrease in lovebugs -- insects that fly connected and coated Florida's windshields in the 1970s and 1980s. This year, he said, ""was kind of disappointing, I thought.""

University of Nevada, Reno, researcher Lee Dyer and his colleagues have been looking at insects at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica since 1991. There's a big insect trap sheet under black light that decades ago would be covered with bugs. Now, ""there's no insects on that sheet,"" he said.

But there's not much research looking at all flying insects in big areas.

THE EVIDENCE

Last year, a study that found an 82 percent mid-summer decline in the number and weight of bugs captured in traps in 63 nature preserves in Germany compared with 27 years earlier. It was one of the few, if only, broad studies. Scientists say similar comparisons can't be done elsewhere because similar bug counts weren't done decades ago.

""We don't know how much we're losing if we don't know how much we have,"" said University of Hawaii entomologist Helen Spafford.

The lack of older data makes it ""unclear to what degree we're experiencing an arthropocalypse,"" said University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum. Individual studies aren't convincing in themselves, ""but the sheer accumulated weight of evidence seems to be shifting"" to show a problem, she said.

After the German study, countries started asking if they have similar problems, said ecologist Toke Thomas Hoye of Aarhus University in Denmark. He studied flies in a few spots in remote Greenland and noticed an 80 percent drop in numbers since 1996.

""It's clearly not a German thing,"" said University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, who has chronicled declines in moth populations in the northeastern United States. ""We just need to find out how widespread the phenomenon is.""

THE SUSPECTS

Most scientists say lots of factors, not just one, caused the apparent decline in flying insects.

Suspects include habitat loss, insecticide use, the killing of native weeds, single-crop agriculture, invasive species, light pollution, highway traffic and climate change.

""It's death by a thousand cuts, and that's really bad news,"" Wagner said.

To Tallamy, two causes stand out: Humans' war on weeds and vast farmland planted with the same few crops.

Weeds and native plants are what bugs eat and where they live, Tallamy said. Milkweeds, crucial to the beautiful monarch butterfly, are dwindling fast. Manicured lawns in the United States are so prevalent that, added together, they are as big as New England, he said.

Those landscapes are ""essentially dead zones,"" he said.

Light pollution is another big problem for species such as moths and fireflies, bug experts said. Insects are attracted to brightness, where they become easy prey and expend energy they should be using to get food, Tallamy said.

Jesse Barber of Boise State is in the middle of a study of fireflies and other insects at Grand Teton National Park. He said he notices a distinct connection between light pollution and dwindling populations.

""We're hitting insects during the day, we're hitting them at night,"" Tallamy said. ""We're hitting them just about everywhere.""

Lawns, light pollution and bug-massacring highway traffic are associated where people congregate. But Danish scientist Hoye found a noticeable drop in muscid flies in Greenland 300 miles from civilization. His studies linked declines to warmer temperatures.

Other scientists say human-caused climate change may play a role, albeit small.

RESTORING HABITAT

Governments are trying to improve the situation. Maryland is in a three-year experiment to see if planting bee-friendly native wildflowers helps.

University of Maryland entomology researcher Lisa Kuder says the usual close-crop ""turf is basically like a desert"" that doesn't attract flying insects. She found an improvement -- 70 different species and records for bees -- in the areas where flowers are allowed to grow wild and natural alongside roads.

The trouble is that it is so close to roadways that Tallamy fears that the plants become ""ecological traps where you're drawing insects in and they're all squashed by cars.""

Still, Tallamy remains hopeful. In 2000, he moved into this rural area between Philadelphia and Baltimore and made his 10-acre patch all native plants, creating a playground for bugs. Now he has 861 species of moths and 54 species of breeding birds that feed on insects.

Wagner, of the University of Connecticut, spends his summers teaching middle schoolers in a camp to look for insects, like he did decades ago. They have a hard time finding the cocoons he used to see regularly.

""The kids I'm teaching right now are going to think that scarce insects are the rule,"" Wagner said. ""They're not realizing that there could be an ecological disaster on the horizon.""",10,0.4,2,0.08,Bye Bye Bugs?

A team led by scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has, for the first time, developed nanoscale devices that divide incident white light into its component colors based on the direction of illumination, or directs these colors to a predetermined set of output angles.

Schematic shows two different ways that white light interacts with a newly developed device, a directional color filter ruled with grooves that are not uniformly spaced. When white light illuminates the patterned side of the compact metal device at three different angles--in this case, 0deg degrees, 10deg and 20deg--the device transmits light at red, green and blue wavelengths, respectively. When white light incident at any angle illuminates the device from the non-patterned side, it separates the light into the same three colors, and sends off each color in different directions corresponding to the same respective angles. Credit: NIST

Viewed from afar, the device, referred to as a directional color filter, resembles a diffraction grating, a flat metal surface containing parallel grooves or slits that split light into different colors. However, unlike a grating, the nanometer-scale grooves etched into the opaque metal film are not periodic--not equally spaced. They are either a set of grooved lines or concentric circles that vary in spacing, much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These properties shrink the size of the filter and allow it to perform many more functions than a grating can.

For instance, the device's nonuniform, or aperiodic, grid can be tailored to send a particular wavelength of light to any desired location. The filter has several promising applications, including generating closely spaced red, green and blue color pixels for displays, harvesting solar energy, sensing the direction of incoming light and measuring the thickness of ultrathin coatings placed atop the filter.

In addition to selectively filtering incoming white light based on the location of the source, the filter can also operate in a second way. By measuring the spectrum of colors passing through a filter custom-designed to deflect specific wavelengths of light at specific angles, researchers can pinpoint the location of an unknown source of light striking the device. This could be critical to determine if that source, for instance, is a laser aimed at an aircraft.

""Our directional filter, with its aperiodic architecture, can function in many ways that are fundamentally not achievable with a device such as a grating, which has a periodic structure,"" said NIST physicist Amit Agrawal. ""With this custom-designed device, we are able to manipulate multiple wavelengths of light simultaneously.""

Matthew Davis and Wenqi Zhu of NIST and the University of Maryland, along with Agrawal and NIST physicist Henri Lezec, described their work in the latest edition of Nature Communications. The work was performed in collaboration with Syracuse University and Nanjing University in China.

The operation of the directional color filter relies on the interaction between the incoming particles of light--photons--and the sea of electrons that floats along the surface of a metal. Photons striking the metal surface create ripples in this electron sea, generating a special type of light wave--plasmons--that has a much smaller wavelength than the original light source.

The design and operation of aperiodic devices are not as intuitive and straightforward as their periodic counterparts. However, Agrawal and his colleagues have developed a simple model for designing these devices. Lead author Matthew Davis explained, ""this model allows us to quickly predict the optical response of these aperiodic designs without relying on time-consuming numerical approximation, thereby greatly decreasing the design time so we can focus on device fabrication and testing.""

The strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men was found to be self-reported health, which can be acquired without a physical examination, whereas the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women was a previous cancer diagnosis.

2. The strongest predictors of all-cause mortality were measures of smoking habits when individuals with major diseases or disorders were excluded.

3. A prognostic score developed in this study was accurate in predicting 5-year mortality risk using 13 predictors for men and 11 for women.

Evidence Rating Level: 1 (Excellent)

Study Rundown: Prediction of mortality using prognostic indicators is critical for accurate clinical decision-making. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank health database, this study aimed to investigate predictors of all-cause and cause-specific mortality during a 5-year period, and to create a prediction score for 5-year mortality using only self-reported information. Data from about 500,000 UK Biobank participants on 655 demographics, health, and lifestyle measurements were assessed for sex-specific associations with 5-year all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories utilizing the Cox proportional hazard model.

The strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men was found to be self-reported health, which can be obtained without the need for a physical examination, whereas the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women was a previous cancer diagnosis. The strongest predictors of all-cause mortality were measures of smoking habits when individuals with major diseases or disorders were excluded. Finally, a prognostic index for 5 year-mortality calibrated for individuals aged 40-70 years was accurate in predicting health risk. This study's prospective design with high rates of follow-up is a key strength of this analysis. The predictions this study makes must be interpreted with caution when applied across populations, due to similarity of the test cohort.

In-Depth [prospective cohort]: This prospective population-based study aimed to assess various predictors of mortality utilizing data from the UK Biobank database. Data from 498,103 participants aged 37-73 years, from England, Wales, and Scotland who were enrolled in the UK Biobank project from April 2007 to July 2010 were analyzed for sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of health, demographics, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause specific mortality categories. Variables missing in over 80% of participants were excluded from the analysis.

8,532 individuals (including 39% women) died during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. The strongest predictor or all-cause mortality in men was self-reported health (C-index including age 0.74 [95% CI 0.73-0.75]). The strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women was to be a previous cancer diagnosis (0.73 [0.72-0.74]). Measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality when individuals with major diseases or disorders were excluded (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355,043). A prognostic score based on 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved better performance than the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0.0001 in men and p=0.0007 in women) and good discrimination (0.80 [0.77-0.83] for men and 0.79 [0.76-0.83] for women).

Major volcanic eruptions, in part",0.5925925925925926,1,"While human activity has been the dominant driver of climate change over the past century, natural factors can influence short-term variations in global temperature.

Major volcanic eruptions, in particular, can have a sizable cooling impact on the climate lasting for five years or so.

The Mount Agung volcano in Bali, Indonesia, has been showing signs that an eruption is likely to occur this year. Last time Agung erupted, back in 1963, it had a noticeable cooling effect on the Earth's climate.

Here, Carbon Brief examines how volcanoes influence the climate, and suggests that a new Agung eruption would likely only result in a modest and temporary cooling of global temperatures.

Volcanoes and climate change

Volcanoes generally have a cooling influence on the Earth's surface.

Eruptions send a cloud of ash and dust high into the atmosphere. The sulphur dioxide released combines with water to form sulfuric acid aerosols, which reflect incoming sunlight and influence cloud formation. When eruptions are powerful enough to reach the stratosphere (18 km or more above the surface at the equator), these sulphate aerosols can stay aloft for a number of years and have a strong cooling effect on the climate.

Volcanic eruptions also release CO2 into the atmosphere, meaning they contribute to warming by strengthening the greenhouse effect. But this influence is very small, and is outweighed by the cooling impact of the dust and ash.

The location of volcanoes also matter. Major volcanic eruptions near the equator are more likely to have a big effect on global temperatures, while high-latitude eruptions (like Laki) will have their effects more limited to the one hemisphere. Sulphate aerosols from high-latitude volcanoes generally will not cross the equator, while tropical volcanoes tend to cool both hemispheres.

The figure below shows an example of what might happen if the Agung erupted today.

The black dots represent the actual measured temperatures (from Berkeley Earth), while the grey shaded areas show the three major volcanic eruptions since 1960 (Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo). The red line shows Carbon Brief's estimate of the warming that can be attributed to the combination of greenhouse gases, volcanoes, and changes in solar output, and blue dip after 2016 shows what could happen to global temperatures if the expected Agung eruption is of the same magnitude as the one that occurred in 1963.





Global mean surface temperatures from Berkeley Earth (black dots), major volcanoes (shaded areas), and estimated temperatures based on human and natural radiative forcing (red) with a 1963-size Agung eruption in mid-2017 (blue). The baseline period is 1961-90. See methods at end of article for details. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

This projection, which is based on the historical relationship between volcanic eruptions and temperature, suggests that an Agung eruption would reduce global temperatures between 0.1C to 0.2C in period from 2018 to 2020, with temperatures mostly recovering back to where they otherwise would be by 2023.

There is no guarantee that an eruption of Agung today would be the same size as the one in 1963, however. A small volcanic eruption that doesn't reach the stratosphere would have a relatively minor climate impact, as sulphur dioxide from the volcano would quickly fall out of the atmosphere.

On the flip side, we have records of much larger volcanic eruptions, such as Tambora in 1815 that may have cooled the globe by 0.6C or more and led to the ""year without a summer"". Even in large eruptions this cooling only lasts a few years, however, as once sulphate aerosols eventually fall back to earth the climate quickly returns to normal.

How much will temperatures actually change?

The change in temperatures after the eruption is hard to predict precisely, partly because we don't yet know what impact the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will have on the climate over the coming decade.

While a response of around 0.2C is expected in neutral ENSO conditions, if the eruption happens to overlap a sizable warm El Nino event or a large cool La Nina event, the impact could be quite different.

To determine exactly how ENSO and volcanoes could interact, researchers at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have undertaken an analysis using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (LE). The CESM LE is a set of 40 different simulations of the same advanced climate model, with only very small differences in initial conditions. The long-term changes are the same in all the model runs, but emergent short-term variability - such as ENSO - differs for each.

The NCAR researchers used the CESM LE to look at the average temperature effect recent major volcanic eruptions: Agung in 1963, El Chichon in 1982, and Pinatubo in 1991, which you can see in black line the left-hand chart below. They found 58 model runs where El Nino conditions were neutral after the eruption. They also identified 32 cases where an El Nino followed the eruption (red line), and 30 cases where a La Nin followed the eruption (blue line).

When eruptions occurred, the average cooling was about 0.2C, with most of the effect dissipating over five years as sulphate aerosols fell out of the stratosphere. When volcanoes were followed by an El Nino event in the models, however, the average cooling was only around 0.1C or less, while volcanoes followed by La Nina events saw an average cooling of 0.3C or more.

Projections of temperature change from an Agung eruption of a similar magnitude to the one in 1963 coinciding with either an El Nino (red) or La Nina (blue) are shown in the right panel. If the eruption coincides with an El Nino event, there may be little to no detectable cooling depending on the size of the eruption. However, if the eruption coincides with a La Nina event, we could witness substantial cooling based on the combination of the two.

Barring an eruption of the magnitude not seen for over 200 years, however, the total effect on the Earth's temperature will be relatively small compared to the warming experienced over the past century.

An Agung eruption similar to 1963 would only reduce temperatures for 2018 down to 2014 levels, all things being equal. It might postpone the date when a new record is set for the warmest year in recorded history, but it will not affect long-term warming driven by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

Methodological note

A variant of Otto et al. (2015) method was used to estimate the efficacy of human and natural radiative forcing on global average surface temperature using a multivariate regression model. The regression model fit observed surface temperatures using both total anthropogenic forcings (greenhouse gases + aerosols) and natural forcings (volcanoes + solar). Thermal response times were adjusted for volcanic forcings to allow a more immediate impact of aerosol cooling.

Forcings were fit to a variant of the Berkeley Earth surface temperature record that had ENSO removed (as per the Foster & Rahmstorf (2011) method). Removing ENSO from the record before fitting forcings is necessary to accurately assess the magnitude of temperature response to volcanic forcing due to the overlap of volcanoes with ENSO events.

An Agung eruption scenario was created by assuming that the volcanic aerosol radiative forcings of the 1963-1966 occur from 2017-2020. Radiative forcing data was obtained from Meinshausen et al. (2011), with data available here.",31,1.1481481481481481,5,0.18518518518518517,Analysis: How could the Agung volcano in Bali affect global temperatures? | Carbon Brief,"While human activity has been the dominant driver of climate change over the past century, natural factors can influence short-term variations in global temperature.

They found 58 model runs where El Nino conditions were neutral after the eruption. They also identified 32 cases where an El Nino followed the eruption (red line), and 30 cases where a La Nin followed the eruption (blue line).

When eruptions occurred, the average cooling was about 0.2C, with most of the effect dissipating over five years as sulphate aerosols fell out of the stratosphere. When volcanoes were followed by an El Nino event in the models, however, the average cooling was only around 0.1C or less, while volcanoes followed by La Nina events saw an average cooling of 0.3C or more.

Projections of temperature change from an Agung eruption of a similar magnitude to the one in 1963 coinciding with either an El Nino (red) or La Nina (blue) are shown in the right panel. If the eruption coincides with an El Nino event, there may be little to no detectable cooling depending on the size of the eruption. However, if the eruption coincides with a La Nina event, we could witness substantial cooling based on the combination of the two.

Barring an eruption of the magnitude not seen for over 200 years, however, the total effect on the Earth's temperature will be relatively small compared to the warming experienced over the past century.

An Agung eruption similar to 1963 would only reduce temperatures for 2018 down to 2014 levels, all things being equal. It might postpone the date when a new record is set for the warmest year in recorded history, but it will not affect long-term warming driven by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

Methodological note

A variant of Otto et al. (2015) method was used to estimate the efficacy of human and natural radiative forcing on global average surface temperature using a multivariate regression model. The regression model fit observed surface temperatures using both total anthropogenic forcings (greenhouse gases + aerosols) and natural forcings (volcanoes + solar). Thermal response times were adjusted for volcanic forcings to allow a more immediate impact of aerosol cooling.

Forcings were fit to a variant of the Berkeley Earth surface temperature record that had ENSO removed (as per the Foster & Rahmstorf (2011) method). Removing ENSO from the record before fitting forcings is necessary to accurately assess the magnitude of temperature response to volcanic forcing due to the overlap of volcanoes with ENSO events.

An Agung eruption scenario was created by assuming that the volcanic aerosol radiative forcings of the 1963-1966 occur from 2017-2020. Radiative forcing data was obtained from Meinshausen et al. (2011), with data available here.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/carbonbrief/~3/cX-8kOR1920/analysis-how-could-agung-volcano-bali-affect-global-temperature,"<div style=""width: 1000px; height: 600px; overflow-y:scroll;""> Please read the following unpublished science news drafted by a journalist and rate the statements below <hr size=""10""> <strong>Analysis: How could the Agung volcano in Bali affect global temperatures? | Carbon Brief</Strong> <br> <hr size=""2""> While human activity has been the dominant driver of climate change over the past century, natural factors can influence short-term variations in global temperature.<br><br>Major volcanic eruptions, in particular, can have a sizable cooling impact on the climate lasting for five years or so.<br><br>The Mount Agung volcano in Bali, Indonesia, has been showing signs that an eruption is likely to occur this year.

The sulphur dioxide released combines with water to form sulfuric acid aerosols, which reflect incoming sunlight and influence cloud formation. When eruptions are powerful enough to reach the stratosphere (18 km or more above the surface at the equator), these sulphate aerosols can stay aloft for a number of years and have a strong cooling effect on the climate.<br><br>Volcanic eruptions also release CO2 into the atmosphere, meaning they contribute to warming by strengthening the greenhouse effect. But this influence is very small, and is outweighed by the cooling impact of the dust and ash.<br><br>The location of volcanoes also matter. Major volcanic eruptions near the equator are more likely to have a big effect on global temperatures, while high-latitude eruptions (like Laki) will have their effects more limited to the one hemisphere. Sulphate aerosols from high-latitude volcanoes generally will not cross the equator, while tropical volcanoes tend to cool both hemispheres.<br><br>The figure below shows an example of what might happen if the Agung erupted today.<br><br>The black dots represent the actual measured temperatures (from Berkeley Earth), while the grey shaded areas show the three major volcanic eruptions since 1960 (Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo). The red line shows Carbon Brief's estimate of the warming that can be attributed to the combination of greenhouse gases, volcanoes, and changes in solar output, and blue dip after 2016 shows what could happen to global temperatures if the expected Agung eruption is of the same magnitude as the one that occurred in 1963.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Global mean surface temperatures from Berkeley Earth (black dots), major volcanoes (shaded areas), and estimated temperatures based on human and natural radiative forcing (red) with a 1963-size Agung eruption in mid-2017 (blue).

A small volcanic eruption that doesn't reach the stratosphere would have a relatively minor climate impact, as sulphur dioxide from the volcano would quickly fall out of the atmosphere.<br><br>On the flip side, we have records of much larger volcanic eruptions, such as Tambora in 1815 that may have cooled the globe by 0.6C or more and led to the ""year without a summer"". Even in large eruptions this cooling only lasts a few years, however, as once sulphate aerosols eventually fall back to earth the climate quickly returns to normal.<br><br>How much will temperatures actually change?<br><br>The change in temperatures after the eruption is hard to predict precisely, partly because we don't yet know what impact the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will have on the climate over the coming decade.<br><br>While a response of around 0.2C is expected in neutral ENSO conditions, if the eruption happens to overlap a sizable warm El Nino event or a large cool La Nina event, the impact could be quite different.<br><br>To determine exactly how ENSO and volcanoes could interact, researchers at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have undertaken an analysis using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (LE).

The tests' predictive powers were assessed for naturally occurring preterm deliveries only, and not for medical procedures such as cesarean surgery or induced labor.

""These methods of assessing women in their first pregnancy do not identify most of those who will later go on to have a spontaneous preterm delivery,"" said senior study author Dr. Uma Reddy. She is with the Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch at the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

""There is a need to develop better screening tests that can be performed early in pregnancy,"" Reddy said in an institute news release.

Preterm birth, defined as a birth before 37 weeks into pregnancy, is the leading cause of neonatal death or long-term disability, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In the United States, more than one in 10 births were preterm in 2015, and about 35 percent of infant deaths were related to prematurity, the agency said.

Two screening tests are typically used to try to predict which women are at high risk for preterm birth, which is hard to predict until it begins, researchers from the University of Utah said in a university news release.

One of the tests is an ultrasound of the cervix. Previous research has suggested that a short cervix early in pregnancy could be a warning sign of preterm birth. The second test checks for fetal fibronectin, a glue-like protein that secures the amniotic sac to the uterus. Some studies have suggested that the presence of fetal fibronectin in the vagina early in pregnancy could also signal an increased risk of preterm birth risk.

To gauge the effectiveness of each of those tests -- or combining both of them -- in predicting preterm birth, researchers at eight clinical centers across the United States tested thousands of women at three points during their pregnancies. The aim: to see whether the results predicted which women would deliver prematurely.

The tests were conducted at around 12 weeks, 19 weeks and 28 weeks of pregnancy. The study didn't include women who'd miscarried before 20 weeks or who had terminated a previous pregnancy, the researchers noted.

After screening more than 9,000 women with first-time pregnancies, the researchers found the two tests identified only a small number of women who would eventually deliver their baby prematurely.

Study lead author Dr. Sean Esplin is a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City and an obstetrics-gynecology professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine.

""This is a huge trial. This study was our best hope to say how effectively these tests predict the likelihood of preterm birth, and they weren't as effective as we'd hoped,"" Esplin said.

The study was published March 14 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Women of African-American descent have to rethink having that second glass of alcoholic drink as a new study links the increased cases of breast cancer with alcohol intake. The study is specifically directed to African-American women.

The link between alcohol and breast cancer has been proven in the past, but what makes thisb study different is its focus on African-American women.

Researchers from the University of North Carolina conducted the study called ""Alcohol Intake and Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women from the AMBER Consortium.""

The study showed that similar to European women, African-American women drinking 7 or more alcoholic DPW was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer regardless of subtype. The paper was published by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).

The research was conducted with the help of 22,338 respondents from the African-American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium (AMBER). All the participants completed questionnaires pertaining to their alcohol consumption that allowed the researchers to conclude that alcohol is linked to increased breast cancer cases in African-American women.

""Alcohol is an important modifiable exposure, whereas many other risk factors are not,"" Melissa A. Troester, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility at the University of North Carolina, said in a press release. ""Women who are concerned about their risk of breast cancer could consider reducing levels of exposure.""

Based on the study, African-American women who tend to drink seven or more each week shows increased risk for all four subtypes of breast cancers mentioned in the study. Also, those who drink 14 or more alcoholic drinks per week have a 33 percent chance of developing breast cancer compared to those with only less than four alcoholic drinks. However, the study also revealed that African-American women drink lesser alcoholic drinks compared to white women.

Not drinking alcohol does not spare women from the disease because there are other factors linked with breast cancer, according to Eurekalert. But the researchers are hopeful that the data that links alcohol to increase breast cancer cases in African-American women can help the group to address the issue of alcohol consumption.

The study showed that similar to European women, African-American women drinking 7 or more alcoholic DPW was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer regardless of subtype. The paper was published by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).

The research was conducted with the help of 22,338 respondents from the African-American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium (AMBER). All the participants completed questionnaires pertaining to their alcohol consumption that allowed the researchers to conclude that alcohol is linked to increased breast cancer cases in African-American women.

""Alcohol is an important modifiable exposure, whereas many other risk factors are not,"" Melissa A. Troester, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility at the University of North Carolina, said in a press release. ""Women who are concerned about their risk of breast cancer could consider reducing levels of exposure.""

Based on the study, African-American women who tend to drink seven or more each week shows increased risk for all four subtypes of breast cancers mentioned in the study. Also, those who drink 14 or more alcoholic drinks per week have a 33 percent chance of developing breast cancer compared to those with only less than four alcoholic drinks. However, the study also revealed that African-American women drink lesser alcoholic drinks compared to white women.

Not drinking alcohol does not spare women from the disease because there are other factors linked with breast cancer, according to Eurekalert. But the researchers are hopeful that the data that links alcohol to increase breast cancer cases in African-American women can help the group to address the issue of alcohol consumption.
