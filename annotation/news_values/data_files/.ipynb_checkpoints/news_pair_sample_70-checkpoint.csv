A comprehensive, 21-year analysis of the fastest-melting region of Antarctica has found that the melt rate of glaciers there has tripled during the last decade.

The glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica are hemorrhaging ice faster than any other part of Antarctica and are the most significant Antarctic contributors to sea level rise. This study is the first to evaluate and reconcile observations from four different measurement techniques to produce an authoritative estimate of the amount and the rate of loss over the last two decades.

""The mass loss of these glaciers is increasing at an amazing rate,"" said scientist Isabella Velicogna, jointly of the UC Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Velicogna is a coauthor of a paper on the results, which has been accepted for Dec. 5 publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

Lead author Tyler Sutterley, a UCI doctoral candidate, and his team did the analysis to verify that the melting in this part of Antarctica is shifting into high gear. ""Previous studies had suggested that this region is starting to change very dramatically since the 1990s, and we wanted to see how all the different techniques compared,"" Sutterley said. ""The remarkable agreement among the techniques gave us confidence that we are getting this right.""

The researchers reconciled measurements of the mass balance of glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Mass balance is a measure of how much ice the glaciers gain and lose over time from accumulating or melting snow, discharges of ice as icebergs, and other causes. Measurements from all four techniques were available from 2003 to 2009. Combined, the four data sets span the years 1992 to 2013.

The glaciers in the embayment lost mass throughout the entire period. The researchers calculated two separate quantities: the total amount of loss, and the changes in the rate of loss.

The total amount of loss averaged 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons). By comparison, Mt. Everest weighs about 161 gigatons, meaning the Antarctic glaciers lost a Mt.-Everest's-worth amount of water weight every two years over the last 21 years.

The rate of loss accelerated an average of 6.1 gigatons (6.7 billion U.S. tons) per year since 1992.

From 2003 to 2009, when all four observational techniques overlapped, the melt rate increased an average of 16.3 gigatons per year -- almost three times the rate of increase for the full 21-year period. The total amount of loss was close to the average at 84 gigatons.

It's normal for icebergs to break off from glaciers, but the Pine Island glacier, one of the largest in West Antarctica, has been calving icebergs at an especially fast pace. Around a year ago, it calved an enormous iceberg 103 sq miles in size; in 2015, a 225-sq-mile chunk broke away, and in 2013, a 252-sq-mile iceberg calved off. Lhermitte estimates the current rift could lead to a loss of ice around 115 sq miles, which would be the sixth significant calving event on the Pine Island glacier since 2001.

Pine Island's ice loss has serious implications for sea-level rise; scientists estimate that if the entire glacier melts, it could raise sea levels by 1.7 ft (about half a meter).

The total amount of loss averaged 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion US tons). By comparison, Mt. Everest weighs about 161 gigatons, meaning the Antarctic glaciers lost an amount of water weight equivalent to Mt. Everest every two years over the last 21 years.

Dec. 13 (UPI) -- A new tool has could supplant the old standard for predicting asthma in children, a study says.

Some doctors say using the Asthma Predictive Index, or API, to forecast asthma in kids isn't always reliable -- and researchers may have a solution for that.

Research published Thursday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology showed that API and the new method Pediatric Asthma Risk Score, or PARS, both predicted asthma risk for children with the most risk factors. But the API missed 43 percent of asthmatic children that PARS picked up as mild to moderate risk.

""PARS is superior to the Asthma Predictive Index (API) in its ability to predict asthma in children with mild to moderate asthma risk, with an 11 percent increase in sensitivity,"" Gurjit Khurana Hershey, director of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's and study senior author, said in a news release. ""Children with mild to moderate risk may be the most likely asthma patients to respond favorably to prevention strategies.""

RELATED Obesity linked to COPD in nonsmokers

Dr. Hershey and other researchers devised the method with data from 762 infants born between 2001 and 2003 whose parents had at least one allergy symptom.

Each year, the doctors tested the children's skin at ages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 for 15 airborne and food allergens that included cat, dog, cockroach, dust mites, trees, mold, weeds, grass, cow's milk and hen's egg. They also tested 589 of kids from the same group when they reached seven, and 11 percent of them had asthma.

In all, the PARS test was 11 percent more sensitive than the API.

This PARS web application provides a scoring system that quickly evaluates a user's risk score.

More than 26 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and black people die from the condition at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Our PARS model either outperforms and/or is less invasive than 30 existing models intended to predict asthma development,"" Hershey said.

They were skin tested for 15 airborne and food allergens including cat, dog, cockroach, dust mites, trees, mold, weeds, grass, cow's milk and hen's egg. Of the 762 infants, 589 were evaluated for asthma development at the age of 7 using objective measures of lung function. Sixteen percent had asthma. The researchers also queried parents for numerous factors that contribute to asthma risk.The children with asthma at age 7 were more likely to have at least one parent with asthma, two or more positive skin tests to airborne or food allergens, eczema at a young age, wheezing apart from colds, frequent wheezing at a young age, a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis in the first three years of life, and to be African-American.The researchers compared the PARS model to the original API and found it to be 11 percent more sensitive than the API.""Our PARS model either outperforms and/or is less invasive than 30 existing models intended to predict asthma development,"" says Dr. Khurana Hershey.

Researchers from the",0.6666666666666666,1,"A new study suggests that social networking sites, such as Twitter, can be used to detect HIV risks and drug use-related behaviors, thus preventing them from spread and outbreak.

Researchers from the University of California concluded that through monitoring, mapping, and linking of tweets on the geographical distribution of HIV cases, sexual risks and drug abuse can be predicted. The use of prohibited drugs was found associated with HIV sexual risk behaviors and its transmission.

In the study, they used over 550 million tweets from May 26 to Dec. 9, 2012, and made an algorithm that would identify words and phrases that suggest sexually-risky and drug abuse behaviors. After that, they mapped the tweets' origin and ran statistical models to find if the tweets originated from places with high HIV cases.

The algorithm showed 8,538 tweets that suggest sexually risky behaviors. Of these, 9.4 percent is from California, nine percent is from Texas and 5.4 percent is from New York - the states with the most tweets. Tweets with drug use-related behavior contents totaled to 1,342.

The origin of tweets that suggest sexually risky behaviors were then linked to the 2009 geographical distribution of HIV cases from AIDSVu.Org, an interactive online map that shows the incidence of HIV in different states in the United States. After linking, they found that the area of risky tweets matches the location where the highest numbers of HIV cases were reported.

The stu",0.25,1,"Real-time social media like Twitter could be used to track HIV incidence and drug-related behaviors with the aim of detecting and potentially preventing outbreaks, a new UCLA-led study shows.

The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Preventive Medicine, suggests it may be possible to predict sexual risk and drug use behaviors by monitoring tweets, mapping where those messages come from and linking them with data on the geographical distribution of HIV cases. The use of various drugs had been associated in previous studies with HIV sexual risk behaviors and transmission of infectious disease.

""Ultimately, these methods suggest that we can use 'big data' from social media for remote monitoring and surveillance of HIV risk behaviors and potential outbreaks,"" said Sean Young, assistant professor of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and co-director of the Center for Digital Behavior at UCLA.

Founded by Young, the new interdisciplinary center brings together academic researchers and private sector companies to study how social media and mobile technologies can be used to predict and change behavior.

Other studies have examined how Twitter can be used to predict outbreaks of infections like influenza, said Young, who is also a member of the UCLA Center for Behavioral and Addiction Medicine; UCLA's Center for HIV Identification, Prevention and Treatment Services; and the UCLA AIDS Institute. ""But this is the first to suggest that Twitter can be used to predict people's health-related behaviors and as a method for monitoring HIV risk behaviors and drug use,"" he said.

For the study, researchers collected more than 550 million tweets between May 26 and Dec. 9, 2012, and created an algorithm to find words and phrases in them suggesting drug use or potentially risky behaviors, such as ""sex"" or ""get high."" They then plotted those tweets on a map to discover where they originated, running statistical models to see if these were areas where HIV cases had been reported.

The algorithm captured 8,538 tweets indicating sexually risky behavior and 1,342 suggesting stimulant drug use. The geographical data on HIV cases to which researchers linked the tweets came from AIDSVu.org, an interactive online map that illustrates the prevalence of HIV in the U.S.; this mapping data was from 2009.

The states with the largest proportion of geo-located tweets, both general as well as HIV-related, were California (9.4 percent), Texas (9.0 percent), New York (5.7 percent) and Florida (5.4 percent). On a per capita basis, the largest raw number of HIV risk-related tweets came from the District of Columbia, Delaware, Louisiana and South Carolina. States with the highest per capita rate of tweets were Utah, North Dakota and Nevada.

When the researchers linked the tweets to data on HIV cases, they found a significant relationship between those indicating risky behavior and counties where the highest numbers of HIV cases were reported.

Based on this study, the researchers conclude that it is possible to collect ""big data"" on real-time social media like Twitter about sexual and drug use behaviors, create a map of where the tweets are occur and use this information to understand and possibly predict where HIV cases and drug use occur.

The study's main weakness, the researchers say, is that the HIV data comes from 2009, so in order to test if this approach can be used to predict future behaviors and outbreaks there is a need for a ""gold standard"" of frequently updated data. In this way, tweets can be accessed instantly to compare them with disease outbreaks.

The study does however demonstrate the feasibility of using real-time social networking to identify and map HIV risk-related communications and link them to national HIV data, the researchers write.

""This study was designed to call for future research to understand the potential cost-effectiveness of this approach and to refine methods of using real-time social networking data for HIV and public health prevention and detection,"" they conclude.",4,0.5,1,0.125,"Twitter 'big data' can be used to monitor HIV, drug-related behavior","Real-time social media like Twitter could be used to track HIV incidence and drug-related behaviors with the aim of detecting and potentially preventing outbreaks, a new UCLA-led study shows.

States with the highest per capita rate of tweets were Utah, North Dakota and Nevada.

When the researchers linked the tweets to data on HIV cases, they found a significant relationship between those indicating risky behavior and counties where the highest numbers of HIV cases were reported.

Based on this study, the researchers conclude that it is possible to collect ""big data"" on real-time social media like Twitter about sexual and drug use behaviors, create a map of where the tweets are occur and use this information to understand and possibly predict where HIV cases and drug use occur.

The study's main weakness, the researchers say, is that the HIV data comes from 2009, so in order to test if this approach can be used to predict future behaviors and outbreaks there is a need for a ""gold standard"" of frequently updated data. In this way, tweets can be accessed instantly to compare them with disease outbreaks.

The study does however demonstrate the feasibility of using real-time social networking to identify and map HIV risk-related communications and link them to national HIV data, the researchers write.

People who carry this gene variant have larger volumes",0.4166666666666667,1,"A gene variant believed to ""wire"" people to live longer might also ensure that they keep their wits about them as they age, a new study reports.

People who carry this gene variant have larger volumes in a front part of the brain involved in planning and decision-making, researchers reported Jan. 27 in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology.

These folks performed better on tests of working memory and the brain's processing speed, both considered good measures of the planning and decision-making functions controlled by the brain region in question.

""The thing that is most exciting about this is this is one of the first genetic variants we've identified that helps promote healthy brain aging,"" said study lead author Jennifer Yokoyama, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She noted that genetic research has mainly focused on abnormalities that cause diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

The gene involved, KLOTHO, provides the coding for a protein called klotho that is produced in the kidney and brain and regulates many processes in the body, the researchers said.

Previous research has found that a genetic variation of KLOTHO called KL-VS is associated with increased klotho levels, longer lifespan and better heart and kidney function, the study authors said in background information. About one in five people carries a single copy of KL-VS, and enjoys these benefits.

For this study, the researchers scanned the healthy brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and older to see if having a single copy of KL-VS affected the size of any brain area.

They found that people with this genetic variation had about 10 percent more volume in a brain region called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Yokoyama said.

This region is especially vulnerable to atrophy as people age, and its age-related decline may be one reason why older people can be easily distracted and have difficulty juggling tasks, she said.

Referring to the region as the ""conductor of the brain's orchestra,"" Yokoyama said that it helps people ""pay attention to certain types of things, to appropriately shift your attention and to engage working memory,"" which is the ability to keep a small amount of newly acquired information in mind.

The brain region shrank for everyone, but those with one copy of KL-VS had larger volumes than either people without the genetic variant or those with two copies, the researchers said.

Subsequent ""brain game"" testing found that the size of this brain region predicted how well people performed on memory and problem-solving tests.

Following up on this finding, researchers genetically engineered mice to have higher levels of klotho, said study senior author Dr. Dena Dubal, an assistant professor of neurology at UCSF.

""Not only did the mice live longer, but they were smarter at baseline,"" she said.

In essence, the one in five people with a single copy of this genetic variation will undergo natural aging of brain function slower than everyone else, Dubal said.

""Our data show that carrying one copy of that variant really confers a decade of deferred decline that you see in aging of that brain region,"" she said.

The findings provide some insight into how medical science may have created a disconnect between the aging of the body and the mind, said Dr. Gayatri Devi, a neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""Because of modern advances in medicine we are living longer,"" even if our genetics would otherwise condemn us to an earlier death, Devi said. ""But as we live longer and longer lifespans, we come into contact with more illnesses that are brain-related."" In other words, medicine to help the brain age gracefully has not kept pace with medicine that helps the body live longer.

While these findings are very preliminary, they could one day lead to treatments that slow brain aging and help people suffering from dementia, Dubal said.

""If one can boost brain structure and function, maybe that could counter the effects of devastating diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,"" she said.",5,0.4166666666666667,0,0.0,"""Long life"" gene might also make some smarter","A gene variant believed to ""wire"" people to live longer might also ensure that they keep their wits about them as they age, a new study reports.

The gene involved, KLOTHO, provides the coding for a protein called klotho that is produced in the kidney and brain and regulates many processes in the body, the researchers said.

Previous research has found that a genetic variation of KLOTHO called KL-VS is associated with increased klotho levels, longer lifespan and better heart and kidney function, the study authors said in background information. About one in five people carries a single copy of KL-VS, and enjoys these benefits.

For this study, the researchers scanned the healthy brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and older to see if having a single copy of KL-VS affected the size of any brain area.

They found that people with this genetic variation had about 10 percent more volume in a brain region called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Yokoyama said.

This region is especially vulnerable to atrophy as people age, and its age-related decline may be one reason why older people can be easily distracted and have difficulty juggling tasks, she said.

Referring to the region as the ""conductor of the brain's orchestra,"" Yokoyama said that it helps people ""pay attention to certain types of things, to appropriately shift your attention and to engage working memory,"" which is the ability to keep a small amount of newly acquired information in mind.

The brain region shrank for everyone, but those with one copy of KL-VS had larger volumes than either people without the genetic variant or those with two copies, the researchers said.

Subsequent ""brain game"" testing found that the size of this brain region predicted how well people performed on memory and problem-solving tests.

Following up on this finding, researchers genetically engineered mice to have higher levels of klotho, said study senior author Dr. Dena Dubal, an assistant professor of neurology at UCSF.

""Not only did the mice live longer, but they were smarter at baseline,"" she said.

In essence, the one in five people with a single copy of this genetic variation will undergo natural aging of brain function slower than everyone else, Dubal said.

""Our data show that carrying one copy of that variant really confers a decade of deferred decline that you see in aging of that brain region,"" she said.

The findings provide some insight into how medical science may have created a disconnect between the aging of the body and the mind, said Dr. Gayatri Devi, a neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""Because of modern advances in medicine we are living longer,"" even if our genetics would otherwise condemn us to an earlier death, Devi said. ""But as we live longer and longer lifespans, we come into contact with more illnesses that are brain-related."" In other words, medicine to help the brain age gracefully has not kept pace with medicine that helps the body live longer.

While these findings are very preliminary, they could one day lead to treatments that slow brain aging and help people suffering from dementia, Dubal said.

The finding bolsters their previous discovery that middle-aged and older people who carry a single copy of the KLOTHO allele, called KL-VS, performed better on a wide range of cognitive tests. When they modeled KL-VS in mice, they found this strengthened the connections between neurons and enhanced learning and memory.

KLOTHO codes for a protein, called klotho, which is produced in the kidney and brain and regulates many different processes in the body. About one in five people carry a single copy of KL-VS, which increases klotho levels and is associated with a longer lifespan and better heart and kidney function. A small minority, about 3 percent, carries two copies, which is associated with a shorter lifespan.

In the current study, published in Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, researchers scanned the brains of 422 cognitively normal men and women aged 53 and older to see if the size of any brain area correlated with carrying one, two or no copies of the allele.

They found that the KLOTHO gene variant predicted the size of a region called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), which is especially vulnerable to atrophy as people age. Deterioration in this area may be one reason why older people have difficulty suppressing distracting information and doing more than one thing at a time.

Researchers found that the rDLPFC shrank with age in all three groups, but those with one copy of KL-VS, about a quarter of the study group, had larger volumes than either non-carriers or those with two copies. Researchers also found that the size of the rDLPFC predicted how well the three groups performed on cognitive tests, such as working memory -- the ability to keep a small amount of newly acquired information in mind -- and processing speed. Both tests are considered to be good measures of the planning and decision-making functions that the rDLPFC controls.

""We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like klotho can give people a boost and confer resilience in aging,"" said senior author Dena Dubal, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology at UCSF and the David A. Coulter Endowed Chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease. ""Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the devastating diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's and other dementias.""

In statistical tests, the researchers concluded that the larger rDLPFC volumes seen in single copy KL-VS carriers accounted for just 12 percent of the overall effect that the variant had on the abilities tested. However, the allele may have other effects on the brain, such as increasing levels or changing the actions of the klotho protein to enhance synaptic plasticity, or the connections between neurons. In a previous experiment, they found that raising klotho in mice increased the action of a cell receptor critical to forming memories.

""The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and several psychiatric and neurologic diseases including schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse, and frontotemporal dementia,"" said Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD, first author and assistant professor of neurology at UCSF.

People who carry a variant of a gene that is associated with longevity also have larger volumes in a front part of the brain involved in planning and decision-making, according to researchers at UC San Francisco.

The finding bolsters their previous discovery that middle-aged and older people who carry a single copy of the KLOTHO allele, called KL-VS, performed better on a wide range of cognitive tests. When they modeled KL-VS in mice, they found this strengthened the connections between neurons and enhanced learning and memory.

KLOTHO codes for a protein, called klotho, which is produced in the kidney and brain and regulates many different processes in the body. About one in five people carry a single copy of KL-VS, which increases klotho levels and is associated with a longer lifespan and better heart and kidney function. A small minority, about 3 percent, carries two copies, which is associated with a shorter lifespan.

Examining Part of Prefrontal Cortex

In the current study, published Jan. 27, in Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, researchers scanned the brains of 422 cognitively normal men and women aged 53 and older to see if the size of any brain area correlated with carrying one, two or no copies of the allele.

They found that the KLOTHO gene variant predicted the size of a region called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), which is especially vulnerable to atrophy as people age. Deterioration in this area may be one reason why older people have difficulty suppressing distracting information and doing more than one thing at a time.

Researchers found that the rDLPFC shrank with age in all three groups, but those with one copy of KL-VS - about a quarter of the study group - had larger volumes than either non-carriers or those with two copies. Researchers also found that the size of the rDLPFC predicted how well the three groups performed on cognitive tests, such as working memory - the ability to keep a small amount of newly acquired information in mind - and processing speed. Both tests are considered to be good measures of the planning and decision-making functions that the rDLPFC controls.

""We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like klotho can give people a boost and confer resilience in aging,"" said senior author Dena Dubal, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology at UCSF and the David A. Coulter Endowed Chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease. ""Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the devastating diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's and other dementias.""

Bigger Size Means Better Function

In statistical tests, the researchers concluded that the larger rDLPFC volumes seen in single copy KL-VS carriers accounted for just 12 percent of the overall effect that the variant had on the abilities tested.

However, the allele may have other effects on the brain, such as increasing levels or changing the actions of the klotho protein to enhance synaptic plasticity, or the connections between neurons. In a previous experiment, they found that raising klotho in mice increased the action of a cell receptor critical to forming memories.

""The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and several psychiatric and neurologic diseases including schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse and frontotemporal dementia,"" said Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD, first author and assistant professor of neurology at UCSF. ""In this case, bigger size means better function.

For instance, achieving good health in a community requires not just good medical care, but also attention to transportation, housing conditions and other ""social determinants"" of health.

The Obstacles to Coordination. Collaboration and coordination across agencies and programs is no easy matter at any level of government. For one thing, programs typically arise in different agencies under different laws drafted by different legislative committees. Related programs often end up with different eligibility rules, data systems and reporting requirements, making coordination hard. Agency budgets and policy goals are also typically siloed, with managers focused on their own departments' budgets and goals, not on the larger picture.

Siloed budgets and management also contributes to the ""wrong pockets"" problem. This problem occurs when one agency is best placed to make an investment (such as a city housing agency building safe apartment for frail seniors), but another agency - another pocket -reaps the savings from that investment (in this case the Medicare and Medicaid programs, thanks to a reduction in costly falls). The wrong pockets problem is a feature of ""public goods,"" where many people or agencies - referred to as ""free riders"" - can enjoy the benefits of someone else's spending without contributing their own dollars. As economists point out, if an investing agency is not able to capture much of the generated savings, and yet free riders would be able to benefit, there will be suboptimal investment; in other words, less total investment than would make cost-benefit sense for the whole community.

So how can government agencies tackle these problems? By using tools that economists and businesses are familiar with. Although government differs from business in many ways, government can and does benefit by adopting some private-sector techniques.

Special Product Teams. For example, large private firms routinely set up special product teams with the focused task of coordinating the work of various divisions to design, produce and market a new product. Different levels of government have increasingly been copying this business tool. For instance, back in 1987, Congress created an Interagency Council on the Homeless, an executive branch body designed to coordinate homelessness programs and funding within the federal government, and with lower tiers of government. Similarly, the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs provides focus for youth-related programs in 21 federal agencies. Still, such federal-level bodies are less prevalent than they should be, and stronger White House and congressional leadership is needed to make them more common.

State Teams. States have generally made far more use of the product team model. For instance, more than half the states have now created ""children's cabinets."" These are made up of the heads of state agencies concerned with programs and budgets affecting children and youth, from health and education to corrections and social services; they engage in joint budget planning and service coordination.

Maryland has taken this approach further than most states. Since the mid-1990s, it has supplemented the state children's cabinet with a network of county-level ""local management boards"" (LMBs), which analyze local needs and help coordinate public and even private funds to address those needs. The Anne Arundel County LMB (bordering Baltimore) ""braids and blends"" public funds from federal and state programs, as well as private money, to support local partnerships and cross-sector collaboration.

Pay for Success. When cross-sector efforts require significant capital to cover upfront costs and sustained spending for successes, funding can be even harder to organize and secure. Responding to this challenge, governments here and overseashave turned to the private capital market through so-called ""pay for success"" (PFS) or ""social impact bond"" (SIB) financing. This applies normal venture capitalism to the public sector.

In PFS, governments turn to private firms to provide funding, offering a projected stream of revenue to the firms accruing from future government savings. Importantly, it is the private entities that carry the financial risk; if the project is unsuccessful in generating the expected savings, the investors are not repaid. In one example, New York City turned to Goldman Sachs to invest in an initiative to reduce recidivism among released Rikers Island inmates. In another Denver, Colorado, assembled funding from a range of private investors and foundations to finance housing and services for homeless individuals. Last year Congress allocated $100 million to help encourage SIB ventures.

Fixing Wrong Pockets.

At the leading edge of these private sector-inspired efforts to encourage collaboration are intriguing proposals aimed at overcoming the perverse incentives and underinvestment associated with the wrong pockets problem. And just as in the early days of SIBs, economists are developing and testing innovative tools. In one intriguing example, health economists Len Nichols and Lauren Taylor are seeking to apply an economic model called the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, originally designed to address public goods and free rider problems, to the challenge of optimizing investments in social determinants of health.

In a nutshell, the idea is to create a form of auction, run by a trusted intermediary body. In this auction, institutional stakeholders in a proposed new collaboration - such as health plans, housing agencies, social service department etc. - would each offer financial contributions, or bids, in return for a share of the total expected savings from the proposed collaboration. A well-structure auction would overcome the wrong pockets problem, and optimize the total investment, by assuring that every stakeholder's benefits exceeded their contribution. In a simple example, a state Medicaid program might offer to compensate a housing agency for even more than the cost of making bathrooms safer for the low-income elderly if Medicaid's expected medical savings were large enough.

There is much wrong with the procedures we use in this country to organize programs and agency responsibilities to tackle complex problems, and many structural changes are needed in those procedures. However, by adopting some tools from private sector, governments are helping more cross-sector, cross-agency collaboration to happen.",7,0.875,0,0.0,How private sector tools can enhance governmental cooperation,"In many areas of domestic policy, effective solutions to a problem typically need the coordination of different government programs and agencies.

Research shows that investments in housing, nutrition, and transportation, among other healthy opportunities (commonly known as social determinants of health), can improve health and other dimensions of well-being for vulnerable populations while reducing health care and social service costs. Something as simple as having access to transportation to medical appointments can keep chronic conditions in check and prevent costly hospital stays.

And yet, adequate and sustainable financing of healthy opportunities has eluded most if not all communities in the United States due to the complexity of improving health and managing health care costs.

A new model developed by Dr. Len Nichols, professor at George Mason University's College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) and Lauren Taylor, a doctoral student at Harvard Business School, could help address many complexities of this work, including building coalitions based on trust and establishing pricing rules that are sustainable. The Collaborative Approach to Public Good Investment (CAPGI) model helps participants develop the skills and resources needed for communities to finance the integration of social and health services and provides specific tactics to improve cost and health outcomes.

""This model could help communities and stakeholders spend less on health care, while even more importantly--improving the health of all people,"" explains Nichols. ""We're excited to teach and learn from communities that exhibit the criteria for successful implementation over the next 12 months. After that, we hope to test and evaluate the model, along with our Altarum partners, in the coming months and years.""

The paper Nichols and Taylor recently published in Health Affairs showed how a relatively obscure economic model, appropriately modified, could facilitate sustainable health system savings from something as simple as timely transportation to medical appointments. This can improve health while enhancing the bottom line for public and private insurers, hospitals, health clinics, social and public service providers, employers, and taxpayers.

Taylor observed, ""The challenge of how to appropriately assign prices for public goods is one of the major obstacles standing in front of community coalitions. I'm excited to be part of structuring a fair process by which community actors can share the burden of financing social determinants of health and reap financial and non-financial rewards.""

The project will begin this summer with a series of free webinars or interactive tutorials, the first of which will provide an overview of the model with latter sessions focusing on the details of how the processes attendant to the model would work. Interested participants can register here. The tutorial is open to any willing participant, whether they work for an existing coalition, health care provider or insurance organization, social service provider, local governmental unit such as a health or social service agency, mayor's office or county government, employer coalition, community advocacy organization, philanthropy, faith-based organization, state government, or a consultancy that facilitates the work of any or all of the above.

Following the series of tutorials, the research team will gather data from interested communities, conduct analyses and site visits, and finally assess local conditions and collaborative environments that make successful use of the model more or less likely. A final report will describe lessons learned, creating a road map for other communities in the future.

Faculty from Mason and Harvard will collaborate with the Altarum Institute on the project, made possible with a $500,000 one-year grant from the Commonwealth Fund, the Missouri Foundation for Health, the Episcopal Health Foundation, and the California Health Care Foundation.

Compared to predatory murderers, impulsive murderers are more likely to be developmentally disabled and have cognitive and intellectual impairments -- 59 percent versus 36 percent.

The minds of premeditated murderers are quite different than those who kill impulsively, according to a new study appearing in the latest edition of the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior.

""Impulsive murderers were much more mentally impaired, particularly cognitively impaired, in terms of both their intelligence and other cognitive functions,"" said Dr. Robert Hanlon, senior author of the study and an associate professor of clinical psychiatry and clinical neurology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Murderers whose acts are predatory and premeditated in nature did not typically demonstrate any type of cognitive or intellectual dysfunction, but were more likely to have psychiatric disorders, Dr. Hanlon added.

As part of his research, he studied 77 murderers incarcerated either in the state of Illinois or the state of Missouri. Each of them took standardized intelligence and neuropsychological memory tests.

Compared to impulsive killers, premeditated murderers were nearly twice as likely (61 percent versus 34 percent) to have a history of psychotic or mood disorders, while impulsive murderers were more likely (59 percent versus 36 percent) to have developmental disabilities and cognitive/intellectual impairments, the study claims.

The study is ""the first to examine the neuropsychological and intellectual differences of murderers who kill impulsively and those who kill as the result of a premeditated strategic plan,"" said Sarah Griffiths of the Daily Mail.

According to The Telegraph's Radhika Sanghani, Dr. Hanlon is calling on lawmakers to take intelligence and the mindset of murderers into consideration both in terms of prosecution and crime prevention.

""It's important to try to learn as much as we can about the thought patterns and the psychopathology, neuropathology and mental disorders that tend to characterize the types of people committing these crimes,"" the study author explained.

According to Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Profess",0.5,1,"A Duke University researcher has a new explanation for why those endless days of childhood seemed to last so much longer than they do now -- physics.

According to Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke, this apparent temporal discrepancy can be blamed on the ever-slowing speed at which images are obtained and processed by the human brain as the body ages.

The theory was published online on March 18 in the journal European Review.

""People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,"" said Bejan. ""It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.""

Bejan attributes this phenomenon to physical changes in the aging human body. As tangled webs of nerves and neurons mature, they grow in size and complexity, leading to longer paths for signals to traverse. As those paths then begin to age, they also degrade, giving more resistance to the flow of electrical signals.

These phenomena cause the rate at which new mental images are acquired and processed to decrease with age. This is evidenced by how often the eyes of infants move compared to adults, noted Bejan -- because infants process images faster than adults, their eyes move more often, acquiring and integrating more information.

The end result is that, because older people are viewing fewer new images in the same amount of actual time, it seems to them as though time is passing more quickly.

""The human mind senses time changing when the perceived images change,"" said Bejan. ""The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings. Days seemed to last longer in your youth because the young mind receives more images during one day than the same mind in old age.""",3,0.5,0,0.0,It's spring already?

According to Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke, this apparent temporal discrepancy can be blamed on the ever-slowing speed at which images are obtained and processed by the human brain as the body ages.

The theory was published online on March 18 in the journal European Review.

""People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,"" said Bejan. ""It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.""

Bejan attributes this phenomenon to physical changes in the aging human body. As tangled webs of nerves and neurons mature, they grow in size and complexity, leading to longer paths for signals to traverse. As those paths then begin to age, they also degrade, giving more resistance to the flow of electrical signals.

These phenomena cause the rate at which new mental images are acquired and processed to decrease with age. This is evidenced by how often the eyes of infants move compared to adults, noted Bejan -- because infants process images faster than adults, their eyes move more often, acquiring and integrating more information.

The end result is that, because older people are viewing fewer new images in the same amount of actual time, it seems to them as though time is passing more quickly.

""The human mind senses time changing when the perceived images change,"" said Bejan. ""The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings.

Mechanical engineer Adrian Bejan from Duke University now thinks he has figured out why, and just like ageing, he suspects the experience is both universal and inescapable.

Adhering to the physical laws of life and evolution, Bejan argues that as our eyes fatigue and our brains grow slower, it is only natural to feel as though we are losing time.

""People are often amazed at how much they remember from days that seemed to last forever in their youth,"" he said.

""It's not that their experiences were much deeper or more meaningful, it's just that they were being processed in rapid fire.""

Anyone who has ever watched water come to boil knows intuitively that their ""sense of time"" is only a perception. Far from being a reliable measurement, it's more like a mental construct, constantly changing over time.

This essentially means that the seconds, minutes, and hours we keep in our heads are inherently different to the ones we count on our clocks.

""The time that you perceive is not the same as the time perceived by another,"" writes Bejan.

""Why? Because the young mind receives more images during one day than the same mind in old age.""

Bejan's hypothesis is based on how the brain interprets information from our eyes. The pathways that process visual information start small, but as our neurons mature and grow, they create longer and longer pathways in our brain.

When these neurons begin to age, the path becomes even longer as electrical message meet more and more resistance along the way.

Put simply, an older brain takes longer to process the present. Just look at any baby and you'll notice that their eyes dart about much faster than your own, taking in the scene at a rapid pace.

""Said another way, if the lifespan is measured in terms of the number of images perceived during life, then the frequency of mental images at young age is greater than in old age,"" writes Bejan.

(Bejan, European Review, 2019)

So what does this have to do with the perceived length of time? Well, when a human is focused on the present, say when they are waiting for a pot to boil, they perceive time as having slowed down.

This is because they are checking in on the present more frequently, adjusting their own perceptions of time to match a more objective measurement.

In any given space of time, older people are viewing fewer new images, and this makes it seem as though time is passing more quickly than it does for younger people.

""The present is different from the past because the mental viewing has changed, not because somebody's clock rings,"" explains Bejan.

The finding suggests possible approaches to treating or preventing certain characteristics of OCD.

OCD consists of obsessions, which are recurrent intrusive thoughts, and compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors that patients perform to reduce the severe anxiety associated with the obsessions. The disorder affects 2-3 percent of people worldwide and is an important cause of illness-related disability, according to the World Health Organization.

Using a new technology in a mouse model, the researchers found that repeated stimulation of specific circuits linking the brain's cortex and striatum produces progressive repetitive behavior. By targeting this region, it may be possible to stop abnormal circuit changes before they become pathological behaviors in people at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The study, which was led by Susanne Ahmari, MD, PhD, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia Psychiatry and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, was published in the June 7 issue of Science.

While the obsessions and compulsions that are the hallmarks of OCD are thought to be centered in the cortex, which controls thoughts, and the striatum, which controls movements, little is known about how abnormalities in these brain regions lead to compulsive behaviors in patients.

To simulate the increased activity that takes place in the brains of OCD patients, Dr. Ahmari and her colleagues used a new technology called optogenetics, in which light-activated ion channels are expressed in subsets of neurons in mice, and neural circuits are then selectively activated using light delivered through fiberoptic probes.

""What we found was really surprising,"" said Dr. Ahmari. ""That activation of cortico-striatal circuits did not lead directly to repetitive behaviors in the mice. But if we repeatedly stimulated for multiple days in a row for only five minutes a day, we saw a progressive development of repetitive behaviors -- in this case, repetitive grooming behavior -- that persisted up to two weeks after the stimulation was stopped.""

She added, ""And not only that, when we treated the mice with fluoxetine, one of the most common medications used for OCD, their behavior went back to normal."" The current study, as well as others currently being performed by Dr. Ahmari and her team, may ultimately provide clues for new treatment targets in terms of both novel drug development and direct stimulation techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS).

The study was supported by grants from NIMH (K08MH087718; K24 MH091555), the Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. Scholars Program, the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, the Gray Matters Foundation, the Leon Levy Foundation, and a NARSAD Young Investigator Award.",6,1.0,1,0.16666666666666666,Mice give new clues to origins of obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Columbia Psychiatry researchers have identified what they think may be a mechanism underlying the development of compulsive behaviors.

How can it be stopped? These two questions have propelled two separate teams of researchers to study OCD in mice using a new technology called optogenetics. The light-activated technology stimulated neural circuits in mice, allowing the researchers to both turn on and off obsessive behaviors.

The two studies, conducted separately, were both published June 7 in the journal Science.

The first study was led by Susanne Ahmari, assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University. Ahmari and her team used optogenetics to stimulate a particular region of mice brains using bursts of light. Just stimulating the brain a single time didn't have an effect, but stimulating the brain for five minutes a day for several days in a row created OCD-like behavior. ""We saw a progressive development of repetitive behaviors -- in this case, repetitive grooming behavior -- that persisted up to two weeks after the stimulation was stopped,"" Ahmari said in a press release. Her team then treated the mice with fluoxetine, a commonly used OCD medication, and their repetitive grooming ceased.

Ahmari discusses her research in this video from Columbia University Medical Center:

The second study was conducted by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This study used similar optogenetics techniques but created an opposite reaction from the Columbia study: they blocked obsessive behaviors. ""You don't have to stimulate all the time,"" said senior author Ann Graybiel. ""You can do it in a very nuanced way.""

In this case, the mice tested carried a mutant gene called Sapap3 that is linked to both addiction and repetitive behavior. The mice were specifically trained to groom at certain times after water was dripped onto their foreheads. The researchers then stopped dripping water on the mice, but they continued their grooming behavior. After they stimulated the mice's neurons with light, the grooming behavior ceased.

Both teams say their research could have future benefits for humans with OCD, Tourette's syndrome and similar conditions.

Optogenetics was invented at MIT, which produced this video in 2011 to explain the technology:

Ahmari and her team used optogenetics to stimulate a particular region of mice brains using bursts of light. Just stimulating the brain a single time didn't have an effect, but stimulating the brain for five minutes a day for several days in a row created OCD-like behavior. ""We saw a progressive development of repetitive behaviors -- in this case, repetitive grooming behavior -- that persisted up to two weeks after the stimulation was stopped,"" Ahmari said in a press release.

This study used similar optogenetics techniques but created an opposite reaction from the Columbia study: they blocked obsessive behaviors.

""You can do it in a very nuanced way.""<br><br>In this case, the mice tested carried a mutant gene called Sapap3 that is linked to both addiction and repetitive behavior. The mice were specifically trained to groom at certain times after water was dripped onto their foreheads. The researchers then stopped dripping water on the mice, but they continued their grooming behavior. After they stimulated the mice's neurons with light, the grooming behavior ceased.<br><br>Both teams say their research could have future benefits for humans with OCD, Tourette's syndrome and similar conditions.<br><br>Optogenetics was invented at MIT, which produced this video in 2011 to explain the technology:<br><br>Related on MNN: Singing mice can change their tune<br><br>OCD both triggered and treated in mice [Video]<br><br>Two teams of researchers have used new techniques to provide clues into compulsive behavior. </div>"

Traces of salt trapped in many diamonds show the stones are formed from ancient seabeds that became buried ",0.26666666666666666,1,"The diamond on your finger is most likely made of recycled seabed cooked deep in the Earth.

Traces of salt trapped in many diamonds show the stones are formed from ancient seabeds that became buried deep beneath the Earth's crust, according to new research led by Macquarie University geoscientists in Sydney, Australia.

Most diamonds found at the Earth's surface are formed this way; others are created by crystallization of melts deep in the mantle.

In experiments recreating the extreme pressures and temperatures found 200 kilometres underground, Dr Michael Forster, Professor Stephen Foley, Dr Olivier Alard, and colleagues at Goethe Universitat and Johannes Gutenberg Universitat in Germany, have demonstrated that seawater in sediment from the bottom of the ocean reacts in the right way to produce the balance of salts found in diamond.

The study, published in Science Advances, settles a long-standing question about the formation of diamonds. ""There was a theory that the salts trapped inside diamonds came from marine seawater, but couldn't be tested,"" says lead author Michael. ""Our research showed that they came from marine sediment.""

Diamonds are crystals of carbon that form beneath the Earth's crust in very old parts of the mantle. They are brought to the surface in volcanic eruptions of a special kind of magma called kimberlite.

While gem diamonds are usually made of pure carbon, so-called fibrous diamonds, which are cloudy and less appealing to jewellers, often include small traces of sodium, potassium and other minerals that reveal information about the environment where they formed.

These fibrous diamonds are commonly ground down and used in technical applications like drill bits.

Fibrous diamonds grow more quickly than gem diamonds, which means they trap tiny samples of fluids around them while they form.

""We knew that some sort of salty fluid must be around while the diamonds are growing, and now we have confirmed that marine sediment fits the bill,"" says Michael.

For this process to occur, a large slab of sea floor would have to slip down to a depth of more than 200 kilometres below the surface quite rapidly, in a process known as subduction in which one tectonic plate slides beneath another.

The rapid descent is required because the sediment must be compressed to more than four gigapascals (40,000 times atmospheric pressure) before it begins to melt in the temperatures of more than 800degC found in the ancient mantle.

To test the idea, team members at the Johannes Gutenberg Universitat Mainz and Goethe Universitat Frankfurt in Germany carried out a series of high-pressure, high-temperature experiments.

They placed marine sediment samples in a vessel with a rock called peridotite that is the most common kind of rock found in the part of the mantle where diamonds form. Then they turned up the pressure and the heat, giving the samples time to react with one another in conditions like those found at different places in the mantle.

At pressures between four and six gigapascals and temperatures between 800degC and 1100degC, corresponding to depths of between 120 and 180 kilometres below the surface, they found salts formed with a balance of sodium and potassium that closely matches the small traces found in diamonds.

""We demonstrated that the processes that lead to diamond growth are driven by the recycling of oceanic sediments in subduction zones,"" says Michael.

""The products of our experiments also resulted in the formation of minerals that are necessary ingredients for the formation of kimberlite magmas, which transport diamonds to the Earth's surface.""",7,0.4666666666666667,1,0.06666666666666667,Earth recycles ocean floor into diamonds,"The diamond on your finger is most likely made of recycled seabed cooked deep in the Earth.

Traces of salt trapped in many diamonds show the stones are formed from ancient seabeds that became buried deep beneath the Earth's crust, according to new research led by Macquarie University geoscientists in Sydney, Australia.

Most diamonds found at the Earth's surface are formed this way; others are created by crystallization of melts deep in the mantle.

In experiments recreating the extreme pressures and temperatures found 200 kilometres underground, Dr Michael Forster, Professor Stephen Foley, Dr Olivier Alard, and colleagues at Goethe Universitat and Johannes Gutenberg Universitat in Germany, have demonstrated that seawater in sediment from the bottom of the ocean reacts in the right way to produce the balance of salts found in diamond.

The study, published in Science Advances, settles a long-standing question about the formation of diamonds. ""There was a theory that the salts trapped inside diamonds came from marine seawater, but couldn't be tested,"" says lead author Michael. ""Our research showed that they came from marine sediment.""

Diamonds are crystals of carbon that form beneath the Earth's crust in very old parts of the mantle. They are brought to the surface in volcanic eruptions of a special kind of magma called kimberlite.

While gem diamonds are usually made of pure carbon, so-called fibrous diamonds, which are cloudy and less appealing to jewellers, often include small traces of sodium, potassium and other minerals that reveal information about the environment where they formed.

These fibrous diamonds are commonly ground down and used in technical applications like drill bits.

Fibrous diamonds grow more quickly than gem diamonds, which means they trap tiny samples of fluids around them while they form.

""We knew that some sort of salty fluid must be around while the diamonds are growing, and now we have confirmed that marine sediment fits the bill,"" says Michael.

For this process to occur, a large slab of sea floor would have to slip down to a depth of more than 200 kilometres below the surface quite rapidly, in a process known as subduction in which one tectonic plate slides beneath another.

Diamonds are extremely valuable, but new research supports the theory that they're likely just recycled seabed, albeit, ""cooked"" for millions and millions of years.

The Origins Of Diamonds

These precious rocks take so long to form that it's challenging for scientists to trace their origins accurately. Traces of salt found in plenty of diamonds offer clue, however.

""There was a theory that the salts trapped inside diamonds came from marine seawater, but couldn't be tested,"" explained study lead author and professor Dr. Michael Forster of Macquarie University in a statement, adding that their research was able to show that these salts originated from marine sediment.

According to Live Science, one theory is that huge slabs of the sea floor containing plenty of minerals drop rapidly into the Earth's mantle where the crushing pressures and ultra-high temperatures cause them to crystallize. In time, these crystals combine with a specific type of volcanic magma known as kimberlite and burst onto the surface as diamonds.

Recreating Diamond Formation

In the new study published in the journal Science Advances, Forster and the rest of the team used fibrous diamonds, which are diamond variants that are not pure carbon.

Instead, this cloudy type of diamond contain small amounts of sodium, potassium, and other minerals. While they're less valuable to jewelers and collectors, fibrous diamonds are extremely useful to geologists as they reveal more about the history and environment of its formation.

Fibrous diamonds are known to grow more rapidly than gem diamonds, which means they end up trapping tiny pockets of liquid while forming.

To see whether these salty liquids are from the ocean, the authors conducted experiments that recreated the conditions of diamond formation.

Marine sediment samples were placed in a vessel with a peridotite rock, which is the most common type of rock in the section of the mantle where diamonds are created.

Then, these were exposed to the extreme pressures and temperatures found 75 to 112 miles (120 to 180 kilometers) under the Earth's surface. Pressures ranged from four to six gigapascals, while temperatures varied between 1472 and 2012 degrees Fahrenheit (800 to 1100 degrees Celsius).

Under these conditions, the team found that salts formed with a similar composition of salts found in diamonds.

""We demonstrated that the processes that lead to diamond growth are driven by the recycling of oceanic sediments in subduction zones,"" said Forster. ""The products of our experiments also resulted in the formation of minerals that are necessary ingredients for the formation of kimberlite magmas, which transport diamonds to the Earth's surface.""

The Report - Initial Thoughts

The EPA has released draft toxicity assessments for GenX chemicals and PFBS , both members of a larger group of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( PFAS ). GenX and PFBS are being used as replacement chemicals for PFOA and PFOS, the original Teflon chemicals that were forced off the market due to their decades-long persistence in the environment and their link to serious health harms in exposed people and wildlife.EPA's assessment confirms what many have feared - taking PFOA and PFOS off the market and out of products has only led to industry replacing them with related PFAS chemicals that pose similar risks - a 'regrettable substitution'.PFAS chemicals have been used for decades to provide non-stick, stain- and water-resistant properties to products such as carpet, furniture, cookware, and food packaging. They are also used in fire-fighting foams and industrially as surfactants, emulsifiers, and coatings. PFAS are lab-made, meaning they don't occur naturally. And they are extremely resistant to degradation in our environment. Some PFAS have been shown to build up in our bodies for years. PFAS chemicals have been linked to many different health effects including; kidney and testicular cancer, immune system dysfunction, developmental and reproductive harm, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, and liver damage.After decades of use, PFAS chemicals have poisoned our air, water, soil, and food. As a result, the blood of virtually all Americans is contaminated with these toxic chemicals. Some communities are struggling with drinking water tainted with PFAS levels hundreds to thousands of times higher than EPA's 'do not exceed' health advisory limit for PFOA and PFOS. And EPA's advisory does not even reflect the most recent science on PFAS. A recent CDC report generated health thresholds approximately 10 times stricter than the EPA's.In response to public pressure due to growing concerns about the health effects of PFOA and PFOS, industry voluntarily phased them out but unfortunately replaced them with alternative, often shorter chain versions of PFAS chemicals such as GenX and PFBS. Because short-chain PFAS are thought to be eliminated from our bodies faster than legacy PFAS, it was argued that they were safe. But the more these alternative PFAS chemicals are studied, the more evident it becomes that this is not the case.The EPA report confirmed that GenX is associated with harmful effects on the kidney, blood, immune system, liver and development. The EPA also linked it to an elevated risk of cancer (suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential). EPA's proposed health threshold, called a reference dose, for GenX is in the same range as EPA's reference dose for PFOA (0.00008 mg/kg/day for GenX versus 0.00002 mg/kg/day for PFOA).Although EPA's proposed reference dose for PFBS suggests it is not as toxic as PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS and GenX, the EPA still found that PFBS is associated with harmful effects on the thyroid and kidney, reproduction and development.It is extremely concerning that GenX and PFBS are both linked to similar health harms as the chemicals they have replaced.GenX and PFBS are often found as a mixture with other PFAS in the environment. Because they are associated with similar health harms, their effects could be additive. Additionally, as pointed out in the 2014 Helsingor statement by experts in the field, ""The levels of some fluorinated alternatives or their degradation products, such as perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) ... have been shown to be rising in recent years in the environment and human tissue..."". Rising levels of highly toxic chemicals in our bodies and our environment is a clear call for regulatory agencies like EPA to take health-protective action.EPA's draft assessments provide more evidence that we need to regulate the whole class of chemicals. If we regulate only a handful of PFAS, there will be swift regrettable substitution with other, similarly toxic PFAS - creating a ""whack a mole"" problem in which we fail to ever establish effective safeguards to limit this growing class of dangerous chemicals.EPA found data supporting similar health effects as PFOA and PFOS, but their proposed reference dose only examines GenX or PFBS toxicity in isolation.For GenX, the evaluation of studies was called ""arbitrary"" by an external reviewer of the report. Another reviewer highlighted the lack of rigorous animal and human studies published in well-regarded journals. As a result, there was a heavy reliance on DuPont studies, most of which were not published in peer-reviewed journals. This could be problematic given the evidence that industry-sponsored studies are often biased to favor the regulatory approval of their products (see recent examples here here , and here ).Uncertainties in data were not properly acknowledged. Uncertainty factors are used by agencies to account for any uncertainties encountered in generating health thresholds. To ""apply"" them, the health threshold is divided by uncertainty factors, which lowers the health threshold to a more protective level. The greater the uncertainty factor applied, the lower and more protective the final health threshold becomes.For example, the EPA use a 3x uncertainty factor for database limitations for GenX. However, lack of data on known sensitive health effects for other PFAS, such as harm to the immune system, should warrant a larger uncertainty factor for database limitations. In fact, the CDC added a 10x uncertainty factor for database limitations for two related PFAS, PFHxS and PFNA, because there was a lack of data on immunotoxicity and development, which they have determined are very sensitive health effects for PFAS.NRDC also recommends applying another 10x uncertainty factor to protect fetuses, infants, and children - the group most vulnerable to the effects of PFAS exposure - as is required for pesticides under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), where exposures during early life may be particularly harmful.If the proper level of uncertainty was acknowledged, the reference dose for GenX would be at least 10 times stricter.The EPA is seeking public input on its draft assessments for the next 60 days. NRDC will be submitting detailed scientific and legal comments, encouraging EPA to take meaningful action to protect human health and wildlife from this family of toxic chemicals.",4,1.3333333333333333,1,0.3333333333333333,Regrettable substitution: EPA finds replacements for toxic teflon chemicals...Toxic,"What EPA Found

The problem with fluorochemicals is that they are difficult to break down and accumulate in both humans and the environment. Some fluorochemicals have known correlations with harmful health effects, such as cancer, increased cholesterol and a weaker immune system in children. They can also decrease men's and women's ability to reproduce, and the chemicals can be transferred from mother to child during pregnancy and through breastmilk.

Research chemist, Dr. Xenia Trier from the National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark and a number of international research colleagues therefore recommend that fluorochemicals are only used where they are absolutely essential, as long as measurement methods and knowledge about their potentially harmful effects are limited. The researchers drew up the statement after attending a scientific conference about fluorinated substances (5th International workshop on poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFAS)), held in Helsingor, Denmark in October 2013.

Fluorinated alternatives possibly not better

There is strict regulation around the use of some fluorochemicals in countries like Norway and Canada, and in the US the industry has voluntarily phased out the production of the fluorochemicals which accumulate most in humans. One of these substances is perfluorooctanoic sulfonate (PFOS) and chemicals made from it. These substances are also on the UN's list of known persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which may only be used for a few purposes. Instead industries use other types of fluorochemicals, which accumulate less. Unfortunately, since the fluorinated alternatives in some cases are less effective than those they replace, the alternatives are used in greater quantities, which offsets the benefits of accumulating less. In addition, these alternatives are also persistent.

""Before alternatives are put on the market we recommend that they are tested better than is done today. Just as is required for pesticides and veterinary drugs, producers should be required to develop sufficiently sensitive methods to measure the alternative fluorochemicals for example in food and consumer products and determine the toxicity of the chemicals before they are put on the market. In addition, they should specifically check if the alternatives have similar harmful health effects as those fluorochemicals they replace. Otherwise we risk repeating the mistake of substituting one harmful substance for another similarly harmful chemical,"" Xenia Trier says.

""It is expensive and time-consuming to investigate the potential harmful effects of new fluorochemicals. This bill and the bill for treating people who become sick or have difficulties conceiving, often ends up getting paid for by society,"" Xenia Trier says.

The authors of the Helsingor Statement therefore urge that producers and suppliers not only investigate the alternatives properly, but also make existing data on the substances' chemical and toxicological properties publically available.

Lengthy cleanup

If, in future, it turns out that use of the new fluorochemicals creates environmental and health problems that are as big as the ones created by the substances they were meant to replace, the researchers warn it may take several decades to correct the global contamination problem.

Imagine you walk into a liquor store, and a sexy woman is pouring sample shots of a new brand of whiskey. She urges you to buy a bottle, and you find that idea pretty appealing. Now, instead, imagine that that same woman is asking you to donate to charity.

Moment ruined, right?

That's the gist of the results from a series of experiments conducted at universities in Hong Kong and Singapore, to be published in the December issue of the Journal of Consumer Research. Researchers Xiuping Li and Meng Zhang argue that when people have heightened physiological needs (when they see someone sexually attractive or when they are hungry), they feel less connected to other people, and thus, are less likely to care about others' well-being, to share resources, or otherwise try to help.

Most of the experiments started the same way. Male participants were given a series of photos and asked to choose which one should be the cover of a new magazine. Some were given photos of sexy women (for a fashion magazine, ostensibly), and others were given photos to serve as a control condition--in some cases, natural landscapes (for a travel magazine), or regular-looking women (""the life edition of a magazine,"" which required ""an average person"" on the cover). Some did not look at photos at all.

Men who looked at sexy pictures of women regularly rated themselves as less ""connected"" to their best friends, acquaintances, and even their future selves than men who looked at landscape pictures.

Directly afterwards, the participants were told they were completing a totally different experiment in which they had to make a series of decisions that tested their ""psychological connectedness"" to other people and their willingness to help others.

Among their findings, Li and Zhang report that men who looked at sexy pictures of women regularly rated themselves as less ""connected"" to their best friends, acquaintances, and even their future selves than men who looked at landscape pictures. The photos also appeared to have an influence on decision-making--men who looked at sexy photos were less likely to donate money, to buy a T-shirt promoting a pro-social cause, and to value products described as beneficial to others (versus beneficial to themselves) than men who looked at neutral photos. Statistical analysis showed, at least in the case of buying a T-shirt, that reduced feelings of connectedness were the underlying reason that sexy photos led to uncharitable behavior.

In a different but related experiment, both male and female participants either entering or leaving a cafeteria rated how connected they felt to other people--as the researchers expected, those who had high physiological needs (in this case, hunger) reported feeling less connected to other people.

Li and Zhang write that these findings contribute to work on the ""narrowing effect,"" in which visceral factors (such as cravings, moods, and emotions) may ""narrow the focus of attention, both toward the present over the future and toward the self over others.""

Imagine you walk into a liquor store, and a sexy woman is pouring sample shots of a new brand of whiskey. She urges you to buy a bottle, and you find that idea pretty appealing. Now, instead, imagine that that same woman is asking you to donate to charity.

Moment ruined, right?

That's the gist of the results from a series of experiments conducted at universities in Hong Kong and Singapore, to be published in the December issue of the Journal of Consumer Research.

In a series of studies involving men between the ages of 18 and 24, participants either viewed pictures of sexy women, viewed pleasant pictures such as landscapes, or did not view any pictures. Men who viewed the images of sexy women focused more on how their body felt (tired, excited, sleepy, or bored) and less on their social roles and what kind of person they are (smart, team player, outgoing, etc.).

Men who viewed the images of sexy women saw themselves as having fewer similarities with other people and also felt a sharpened disconnectedness between themselves and others, making them less likely to view a product favorably when it was advertised as having benefits to others. These men were also less likely to behave charitably. In one study, men who were shown the images of sexy women were less willing to give $10 to another student (regardless of whether the other student was male or female) and less likely to show support for wildlife protection by purchasing and wearing a t-shirt that promoted the protection of endangered species.

A team at the University of Leeds used a standard TENS machine like those designed to relieve labour pains to apply electrical pulses to the tragus, the small raised flap at the front of the ear immediately in front of the ear canal.

The stimulation changed the influence of the nervous system on the heart by reducing the nervous signals that can drive failing hearts too hard.

Professor Jim Deuchars, Professor of Systems Neuroscience in the University of Leeds' Faculty of Biological Sciences, said: ""You feel a bit of a tickling sensation in your ear when the TENS machine is on, but it is painless. It is early days -- so far we have been testing this on healthy subjects -- but we think it does have potential to improve the health of the heart and might even become part of the treatment for heart failure.""

The researchers applied electrodes to the ears of 34 healthy people and switched on the TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) machines for 15-minute sessions. They monitored the variability of subjects' heartbeats and the activity of the part of the nervous system that drives the heart. Monitoring continued for 15 minutes after the TENS machine was switched off.

Lead researcher Dr Jennifer Clancy, of the University of Leeds' School of Biomedical Sciences, said: ""The first positive effect we observed was increased variability in subjects' heartbeats. A healthy heart does not beat like a metronome. It is continually interacting with its environment -- getting a little bit faster or a bit slower depending on the demands on it. An unhealthy heart is more like a machine constantly banging out the same beat. We found that when you stimulate this nerve you get about a 20% increase in heart rate variability.""

The second positive effect was in suppressing the sympathetic nervous system, which drives heart activity using adrenaline.

Dr Clancy said: ""We measured the nerve activity directly and found that it reduced by about 50% when we stimulated the ear. This is important because if you have heart disease or heart failure, you tend to have increased sympathetic activity. This drives your heart to work hard, constricts your arteries and causes damage. A lot of treatments for heart failure try to stop that sympathetic activity -- beta-blockers, for instance, block the action of the hormones that implement these signals. Using the TENS, we saw a reduction of the nervous activity itself.""

The researchers found significant residual effects, with neither heart rate variability or sympathetic nerve activity returning to the baseline 15 minutes after the TENS machine had been switched off.

The technique works by stimulating a major nerve called the vagus, which has an important role in regulating vital organs such as the heart. There is a sensory branch of the vagus in the outer ear and, by sending electrical current down the nerves and into the brain, researchers were able to influence outflows from the brain that regulate the heart. Vagal nerve stimulation has previously been used to treat conditions including epilepsy.

Professor Deuchars said: ""We now need to understand how big and how lasting the residual effect on the heart is and whether this can help patients with heart problems, probably alongside their usual treatments. The next stage will be to conduct a pre-clinical study in heart failure patients.""",1,0.16666666666666666,0,0.0,'Tickling' your ear could be good for your heart,"Stimulating nerves in your ear could improve the health of your heart, researchers have discovered.

An unhealthy heart is more like a machine constantly banging out the same beat. We found that when you stimulate this nerve you get about a 20% increase in heart rate variability.""

The second positive effect was in suppressing the sympathetic nervous system, which drives heart activity using adrenaline.

Dr Clancy said: ""We measured the nerve activity directly and found that it reduced by about 50% when we stimulated the ear. This is important because if you have heart disease or heart failure, you tend to have increased sympathetic activity. This drives your heart to work hard, constricts your arteries and causes damage. A lot of treatments for heart failure try to stop that sympathetic activity -- beta-blockers, for instance, block the action of the hormones that implement these signals. Using the TENS, we saw a reduction of the nervous activity itself.""

The researchers found significant residual effects, with neither heart rate variability or sympathetic nerve activity returning to the baseline 15 minutes after the TENS machine had been switched off.

The technique works by stimulating a major nerve called the vagus, which has an important role in regulating vital organs such as the heart. There is a sensory branch of the vagus in the outer ear and, by sending electrical current down the nerves and into the brain, researchers were able to influence outflows from the brain that regulate the heart. Vagal nerve stimulation has previously been used to treat conditions including epilepsy.

Professor Deuchars said: ""We now need to understand how big and how lasting the residual effect on the heart is and whether this can help patients with heart problems, probably alongside their usual treatments. The next stage will be to conduct a pre-clinical study in heart failure patients.""",http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140819200211.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28Latest+Science+News+--+ScienceDaily%29,"<div style=""width: 1000px; height: 600px; overflow-y:scroll;""> Please read the following unpublished science news drafted by a journalist and rate the statements below <hr size=""10""> <strong>Title :'Tickling' your ear could be good for your heart</Strong> <br> <hr size=""2""> Stimulating nerves in your ear could improve the health of your heart, researchers have discovered.

Now researchers have discovered a rather simple technique for improving heart health: tickling the ears. This new study from the University of Leeds has discovered that stimulating nerves in the ear could improve heart health. The study is published in Brain Stimulation.

The stimulation was carried out by applying electrical impulses to the tragus, the small pointed and raised flap situated at the front of the external opening of the ear. It is placed in front of the ear canal. The researchers discovered that electrical stimulation of the tragus altered the effect of the nervous system on the heart by reducing the nervous signals that pump already fragile hearts to work hard. The electrical impulses were applied using a standard TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) machine, which is generally used as an alternative to painkilling medication, as it sends electrical impulses that help to ease certain types of pain, like labor, joint, or period pains, and headaches.

The researchers assessed the efficacy of these machines in improving heart health by applying their electrical impulses on 34 healthy people. The electrodes were applied to the ears of these people for 15-minute sessions. When the TENS machine sends out tiny shocks to the ear, it produces a tickling sensation, according to Professor Jim Deuchars, professor of systems neuroscience in the University of Leeds' faculty of biological sciences.

When the TENS machine was on, the researchers monitored the variability of subjects' heartbeats and the activity of the part of the nervous system that drives the heart. They continued to monitor 15 minutes after the TENS machine was switched off.

""The first positive effect we observed was increased variability in subjects' heartbeats.

A healthy heart does not beat like a metronome. It is continually interacting with its environment -- getting a little bit faster or a bit slower depending on the demands on it,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Clancy, of the University of Leeds' School of Biomedical Sciences, in a statement.

""An unhealthy heart is more like a machine constantly banging out the same beat. We found that when you stimulate this nerve you get about a 20 percent increase in heart rate variability.""

The second positive effect was in suppressing the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS gets triggered in response to a threat to survival -- conditions like stress, depression, aging, or certain medical problems. SNS increases the heart rate by releasing the hormone adrenalin and is often the reason for chronic heart failure.

""We measured the nerve activity directly and found that it reduced by about 50 percent when we stimulated the ear,"" Clancy said. ""This is important because if you have heart disease or heart failure, you tend to have increased sympathetic activity. This drives your heart to work hard, constricts your arteries and causes damage.""

She added that many heart failure treatments aim to stop that sympathetic activity, such as beta-blockers, which block the action of the hormones that implement these signals. Using the TENS machine, she said, the researchers obeserved a reduction in the nervous activity. The results were promising even 15 minutes after the TENS machine had been switched off with neither the heart rate variability nor sympathetic nerve activity returning to the baseline.

But how exactly do these electric impulses regulate the heart beat? They do this by stimulating a major nerve called vagus that is part of the cranial nerves and conveys sensory information about the body's organs to the nervous system. A sensory branch of the vagus is present in the outer ear. With the TENS machine, the researchers were able to send impulses through the nerves into the brain and thus influence the brain's outflows to regulate the heart.

That's 1 percent of the global population. Four times as many men as women are afflicted with the disorder and, while the condition is not life-threatening, it is debilitating as it interferes with effective communication and erodes self-esteem and confidence.

Two new studies from UC Santa Barbara researchers provide new insight into the treatment of stuttering as well as understanding its physiological basis. The first paper, published in the American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, compares a new treatment developed at UCSB to the standard best practices protocol. The second study, which appears in the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, uses imaging to identify abnormal areas of white matter in the brains of adult stutterers.

According to co-author Janis Ingham, a professor emerita of speech and hearing sciences at UCSB and co-author of both papers, the two studies taken together demonstrate two critical points: A neuroanatomic abnormality exists in the brains of people who stutter, yet they can learn to speak fluently in spite of it.

""Together these papers break new ground, one in the treatment area and the other in neuroanatomy,"" said Roger Ingham, a professor of speech and hearing sciences at UCSB and an author on both papers. ""I decided to work with Scott Grafton in the psychology department to see whether it's possible to improve stuttering treatment by having a better knowledge of the neural systems that are functionally related to the disorder.""

A New Approach

Roger Ingham's new Modifying Phonation Intervals (MPI) Stuttering Treatment Program takes a somewhat different approach from the current standard protocol, which teaches stutterers to prolong their speech. The intensive MPI program teaches stutterers to reduce the frequency with which they produce very short intervals of phonation while speaking. A phonated interval is the elapsed time of a voiced unit of speech. In the word ""shout,"" for example, ""out"" is a voiced (phonated) unit; ""sh"" is an unvoiced unit. The MPI program software provides real-time feedback to the stutterer regarding the occurrence of these short phonated intervals so he or she can learn to reduce their occurrence, which improves fluency.

After a lengthy period of basic research and testing, the MPI program was studied in phase II clinical trials with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Ingham and his colleagues found that reducing the frequency of the speaker's short phonated intervals resulted in durable and natural-sounding fluent speech for the majority of study participants.

""It's not a five-minute job,"" said Ingham, lead author of the paper on MPI's efficacy. ""A person who stutters needs to be under this treatment system for two to three hours a day, six days a week for the first phase of the program, which lasts about three weeks.""

MPI treatment is divided into four phases, each designed to be managed jointly by the person who stutters and the clinician. MPI program software is available as an app for the iPad. The clinician uses a ""master"" app to teach the stutterer how to follow the program on an iPad at home.

Increasingly Complex Tasks

Progress is contingent on performance. Once participants complete the initial phase, they move on to increasingly complex speaking tasks until they ultimately conquer what they deem to be their most difficult speaking situations.

""We have to be extraordinarily creative in developing some of these situations,"" Roger Ingham noted. ""We've had participants talking before classes and being interviewed by UCSB's Nobel Prize winners, but we also use Toastmasters where they get a lot of experience speaking in public.""

Ingham's team is currently investigating the use of virtual reality in conjunction with the MPI treatment program. They are exploring whether those difficult speaking situations can be created more efficiently and effectively through reality versions.

The study results show that outcomes for the MPI and prolonged speech treatment groups were similar. However, more people in the MPI program were able to identify and employ the specific speech behaviors necessary for successful treatment. Ingham noted that twice as many people receiving the MPI treatment were successful in maintaining naturally fluent speech 12 months after they finished the program compared to those receiving the prolonged speech treatment.

The Neurophysiology of Stuttering

But what causes stuttering in the first place? The answer appears to lie in the brain's white matter.

Led by Grafton, a professor in UCSB's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, the imaging study used diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) in an MRI scanner to examine the white matter in the brains of eight adult stutterers. DSI is able to parse tracts in the brain and follow them beyond the point where they intersect. Grafton, also a member of the campus's Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies, likens the brain's tracts to highways and surface streets, only in the brain the intersections are three-dimensional.

Grafton and the paper's lead author, Matt Cieslak, a graduate student in Grafton's lab, discovered abnormalities of the arcuate fasciculus, one of the key pathways that connect the language areas of the brain. So named because it forms an arch, the arcuate fasciculus connects at the front of the brain to the area of the cerebral cortex linked to speech production. At the back of the brain, it branches into three parts.

""What's interesting is the back half,"" said Grafton. ""In the vast majority of the stutterers we scanned, there seems to be a large portion of the connection projecting into the temporal cortex, an area of the brain also critical for speech perception. Seven of eight subjects are missing this third branch of the arcuate fasciculus bundle. So in this small group, we can see a really, really strong effect.""

These results required not only sensitive imaging but also completely new analysis methods to examine each tract in the brain separately and at the individual subject level. ""Big advances have allowed us to reconstruct pathways with greater detail than we were able to do before,"" said Cieslak, who developed the new analysis techniques.

""In terms of data, each subject produces what looks like a bowl of spaghetti or a ball of yarn and we had to figure out how to put that data into an analytical framework,"" he explained. ""About 40,000 lines of code later we now have a platform for analyzing white matter data, which can be expanded to a large set of subjects.""

Continuing Exploration

Going forward, the researchers would like to study the brains of recovered stutterers to see whether white matter actually changes with treatment. ""Is there something special in the wiring of people who recover?"" Grafton asked. ""Maybe they are missing part of the arcuate fasciculus pathway but they've got another one that's strong enough to pick up the slack. We'd like to be able to investigate that possibility using DSI.""

Once treated as a psychological or emotional condition, stuttering can now be traced to brain neuroanatomy and physiology, according to the researchers. ""We're one of a number of groups making a strong case that there is something fundamentally different about the brains of people who stutter,"" Grafton said.

""I'm really excited about this work because it's transforming how we do research in patient groups with very common and challenging developmental disorders that have a great impact on people's lives but are otherwise largely ignored in neuroscience and by funding agencies,"" Grafton added. ""They get diagnosed or described and we throw therapies at them but we don't really understand the pathophysiologic basis or the biology of these problems. The fact that we can now see big changes in scans of individuals who stutter is huge. It opens up a lot of opportunities, not just for stutterers but for all kinds of developmental problem like dyslexia, childhood speech apraxia and disorders of coordination.""",2,0.125,2,0.125,"Stuttering: New insight on treatment, physiological basis","Stuttering -- a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables or words are repeated or prolonged -- affects more than 70 million people worldwide.

Stuttering has typically been treated as a psychological or emotional condition, but a new study based on brain scans found that the speech disorder may be linked to irregular white matter in the brain.

Maybe just a crossed wire

Published in the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, the new study applied a technique called diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) in an MRI scanner to analyze the white matter of eight adult stutterers. Researchers uncovered abnormalities of the arcuate fasciculus, one of the pathways that link up the language regions of the brain.

[STORY: Do brain training programs actually make you smarter?]

The arcuate fasciculus attaches at the front end of the brain to the part of the cerebral cortex associated with speech creation. At the rear of the brain, it branches off into three parts.

""What's interesting is the back half,"" said study author Scott Grafton, a brain scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""In the vast majority of the stutterers we scanned, there seems to be a large portion of the connection projecting into the temporal cortex, an area of the brain also critical for speech perception. Seven of eight subjects are missing this third branch of the arcuate fasciculus bundle.""

The study demanded both sensitive imaging, and totally new investigation processes to look at each path in the brain individually and at the individual subject level.

""Big advances have allowed us to reconstruct pathways with greater detail than we were able to do before,"" said lead author Matt Cieslak, a graduate student in Grafton's lab.

""In terms of data, each subject produces what looks like a bowl of spaghetti or a ball of yarn and we had to figure out how to put that data into an analytical framework,"" Cieslak explained. ""About 40,000 lines of code later we now have a platform for analyzing white matter data, which can be expanded to a large set of subjects.""

Goals for the future

The scientists said their future work would analyze the brains of recovered stutterers to see if white matter actually shifts with a treatment program.

""Is there something special in the wiring of people who recover?"" Grafton asked. ""Maybe they are missing part of the arcuate fasciculus pathway but they've got another one that's strong enough to pick up the slack. We'd like to be able to investigate that possibility using DSI.""

[STORY: What causes brain farts?]

""I'm really excited about this work because it's transforming how we do research in patient groups with very common and challenging developmental disorders that have a great impact on people's lives but are otherwise largely ignored in neuroscience and by funding agencies,"" Grafton continued. ""They get diagnosed or described and we throw therapies at them but we don't really understand the pathophysiologic basis or the biology of these problems.""

""The fact that we can now see big changes in scans of individuals who stutter is huge,"" Grafton concluded. ""It opens up a lot of opportunities, not just for stutterers but for all kinds of developmental problem like dyslexia, childhood speech apraxia and disorders of coordination.""

Clinical trials for cancer drugs were shown to lack racial and ethnic diversity in their study populations, according to findings published this week in the journal JAMA Oncology.Researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and Baylor University sought to evaluate the frequency of race reporting and race representation in 230 trials supporting FDA oncology drug approvals from July 2008 to June 2018. The study analyzed 112,293 participants from the 4 major racial and ethnic groups in the United States (white, black, Asian, and Hispanic):Among the 230 trials, 145 (63%) reported on at least 1 group, 18 (7.8%) reported on the 4 major groups, and 58 (25.2%) reported on racial and ethnic subgroups. The differentiation of race reporting in trials between July 2008 and June 2013 versus July 2013 and June 2018 changed nominally (45 [56.6%] vs 100 [67.1%]; for an odds ratio [OR] of 1.63; 95% CI, 0.93-2.87; P = .09), as did race subgroup analysis (13 [16.1%] vs 45 [30.2%]; OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.16-4.67; P = .03).The data revealed a stark contrast in representation for the black and Hispanic populations, with blacks representing 3.1% of trial participants and Hispanics representing 6.1%. Both blacks and Hispanics were underrepresented in trials, with black enrollees representing only 22% of expected incidence and Hispanic enrollees 44% of expected incidence; by contrast, whites were enrolled at 98% their rate of cancer incidence and Asians 438% the expected cancer incidence rate. This lack of representation was further exemplified by the minimal change in proportion from each race enrolled between July 2008 and June 2013 versus July 2013 and June 2018 (blacks, 3.6% vs 2.9% and Hispanics, 5.3% vs 6.7%).A lack of diversity in cancer studies has been documented previously, as scientists from Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in a commentary in 2018 about how fewer than 5% of breast cancer studies were stratified by race and socioeconomic factors.These researchers emphasized the need to prioritize social factors like race to understand correlating vulnerability and mortality rates to specific ethnicities.For many years, assessment devices like the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was only validated for white women, which significantly underestimated the risk of breast cancer in black women who have higher rates of breast cancer at younger ages.By utilizing data derived from a primarily white study group, scientists ignore the impact of cancer drug efficacy on the other 3 major race groups which may prove detrimental to survival rates.Lead study author Jonathan Loree,MD, assistant professor in the department of medicine, division of medical oncology at UBC, provided an instance in which a medication used to treat lung cancer showed mediocre trial results in the general population, but exhibited incredible responses with non-smoking young women in a study in Asia due to a genetic mutation common in this population. Asked in an interview how physicians reacted to his findings, Loree expressed his own astonishment. ""I think physicians were aware that disparities might exist based on prior work, however the magnitude of disparity noted in our study is something that is quite surprising,"" he said.Delving into the distinctions found in each race can exhibit personalized approaches to treating patients based on social factors, but the disparity in race enrollment inhibits this interpretation. Senior investigator in the study Kanwal Raghav, MD, assistant professor in the department of gastrointestinal medical oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, provided additional insight on how to combat these disparities. ""A potential step in this direction would be if the regulatory agencies request postapproval studies fueled with real-world data to help generate evidence and fill the disparity gaps for otherwise underrepresented subgroups in initial studies,"" said Raghav.Raghav's idea for real-world data involvement is an approach the FDA called for in a framework released in December 2018.Back in 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which directed the FDA to develop processes for using real world evidence (RWE) in the course of drug regulation.The FDA joined COTA Healthcare in a 2-year research and collaboration agreement to reform treatment through RWE and electronic health records (EHRs).

It seems like picking a restaurant for dinner involves more research than we put into our college thesis papers. When making almost any decision, we actively gather real world data and evidence on the Internet. In the case of a restaurant, this often comes from diner reviews, social media mentions, and forum postings. Now, imagine if we could gather the same level of real-time data in regards to health across the population and apply the information to developments in treatments, medications, and predicted outcomes.

The 21st Century Cures Act emphasizes a renewed focus on using real world data to power the decisions behind clinical trials. The FDA and Congress define real world data as, ""data regarding the usage, or the potential benefits or risks, of a drug derived from sources other than traditional clinical trials."" This idea was once unfathomable due to excessive data blocking. The 21st Century Cures Act seeks to remedy the practice of information blocking, which can be simply defined as healthcare technology companies restricting the ability to share information outside of their platforms. While progress remains to be made, the widespread adoption of FHIR as a new standard for information exchange has pushed vendors towards greater interoperability.

Lack of Diversity in Real-World Data

Let's go back to the restaurant example. Imagine that you only saw reviews from one type of diner - you may read insights from individuals that have nothing in common with you. Researchers must be cautious that their ""real-world data"" is not only applicable to a specific age group, gender, or race. In a research piece by senior author Dr. Daniel Rubin of Stanford University and lead author Dr. Eli Cahan of Stanford and New York University, researchers found that the majority of data shared today is based on European ancestral genotypes. The authors suggested that greater transparency be presented in regards to the populations that data was collected from.

This isn't the first time that researchers have documented a lack of diversity in studies.

In the article, Social Factors Matter in Cancer and Survivorship, researchers launch into an in-depth study of why the mortality rate for breast cancer remains so much higher for black women than white. Their conclusion is that genetic variants and social factors must play a much greater role in the research data used by scientists. Social factors can include data regarding income, education, social status, ease of access to good healthcare, and life events, like childhood trauma. These can all have a significant outcome on the efficacy of a treatment on a certain population. The authors suggest that ""When possible, findings should stratify these data by race, SEP, country of origin, sexual orientation, health insurance, or other social factors that theory or previous research suggests are important to the exposures or outcomes being studied.""

The popular asthma inhaler, albuterol, is one of the most cited examples of how a lack of diverse data can negatively impact populations. For years, physicians had noticed that albuterol was much more effective in children of European or Mexican descent rather than African American or Puerto Rican descent. Researchers at USCF found that 95 percent of previous studies had focused on people of European descent. A new study with wider genetic variation was able to pinpoint the genetic markers that are more prevalent in people of African ancestry that caused less effective treatment. Today, physicians can use this information to prescribe the right inhaler type.

This data can be collected from a wide variety of sources ranging from electronic health records, billing data, surveys, and even mobile applications. Previously, the ability to collect and organize huge amounts of data was impossible, but today, machine learning and artificial intelligence tools make it possible.

Using existing and diverse data can save clinical trials the costs, time, and negative patient outcomes associated with traditional randomized trials.

Lack of Data Types

Let's turn to that restaurant example one last time. Pictures are a huge part of reviews today. Could you imagine not even looking at one image? Yet, imaging is often the forgotten piece of the puzzle in establishing a holistic patient health record. It is not possible to establish strong research programs without imaging, much of which may already be available in the real world due to screening programs. However, the organization and anonymization of imaging often act as a pitfall. Traditionally, medical imaging is still often exchanged on CDs leading to time wasted mailing CDs, uploading and burning, and manually entering patient information. The process is dangerously error-prone and often delays progress in trials due to the slow input of data. Variations in imaging viewing systems and radiology reporting can also cause inconsistent data.

Rapidly indexing through billions of images and data requires complex IT infrastructure. When looking for solutions, a facility must consider tooling that provides solutions around searching for all relevant data and then appropriately anonymizing and de-identifying data, including the meta-data at the pixel level in the case of medical images. Researchers must determine if tooling is able to properly de-identify data while allowing them to maintain a record of information they've gathered based on certain conditions. For example, researchers may want to index MRI's of a specific tumor type based on gender or age. At a leading academic research center, researchers sought to incorporate increased data types but were frustrated by CD related delays. A partnership with a cloud vendor allowed the facility to securely share imaging over the web and remove patient health information from the DICOM tags client-side before the study leaves the sending facility, eliminating the risk of accidentally leaving PHI (personal health information) tags in place.

Working together, vendors and facilities can establish strategies for gathering real-world evidence, including imaging and diverse data, successfully. The data can then be securely anonymized, shared, and even run through additional processing for the acceleration of clinical trials. The future of trials is bright, and we look forward to the patient care improvements that will be made along the way.

It seems like picking a restaurant for dinner involves more research than we put into our college thesis papers. When making almost any decision, we actively gather real world data and evidence on the Internet. In the case of a restaurant, this often comes from diner reviews, social media mentions, and forum postings. Now, imagine if we could gather the same level of real-time data in regards to health across the population and apply the information to developments in treatments, medications, and predicted outcomes.

The 21st Century Cures Act emphasizes a renewed focus on using real world data to power the decisions behind clinical trials. The FDA and Congress define real world data as, ""data regarding the usage, or the potential benefits or risks, of a drug derived from sources other than traditional clinical trials."" This idea was once unfathomable due to excessive data blocking. The 21st Century Cures Act seeks to remedy the practice of information blocking, which can be simply defined as healthcare technology companies restricting the ability to share information outside of their platforms. While progress remains to be made, the widespread adoption of FHIR as a new standard for information exchange has pushed vendors towards greater interoperability.

Lack of Diversity in Real-World Data

Let's go back to the restaurant example. Imagine that you only saw reviews from one type of diner - you may read insights from individuals that have nothing in common with you. Researchers must be cautious that their ""real-world data"" is not only applicable to a specific age group, gender, or race. In a research piece by senior author Dr. Daniel Rubin of Stanford University and lead author Dr. Eli Cahan of Stanford and New York University, researchers found that the majority of data shared today is based on European ancestral genotypes. The authors suggested that greater transparency be presented in regards to the populations that data was collected from.

This isn't the first time that researchers have documented a lack of diversity in studies.

In the article, Social Factors Matter in Cancer and Survivorship, researchers launch into an in-depth study of why the mortality rate for breast cancer remains so much higher for black women than white. Their conclusion is that genetic variants and social factors must play a much greater role in the research data used by scientists. Social factors can include data regarding income, education, social status, ease of access to good healthcare, and life events, like childhood trauma. These can all have a significant outcome on the efficacy of a treatment on a certain population. The authors suggest that ""When possible, findings should stratify these data by race, SEP, country of origin, sexual orientation, health insurance, or other social factors that theory or previous research suggests are important to the exposures or outcomes being studied.""

The popular asthma inhaler, albuterol, is one of the most cited examples of how a lack of diverse data can negatively impact populations. For years, physicians had noticed that albuterol was much more effective in children of European or Mexican descent rather than African American or Puerto Rican descent. Researchers at USCF found that 95 percent of previous studies had focused on people of European descent. A new study with wider genetic variation was able to pinpoint the genetic markers that are more prevalent in people of African ancestry that caused less effective treatment. Today, physicians can use this information to prescribe the right inhaler type.

Like the Spartans of ancient Greece, the African Matabele ants (Megaponera analis) are fierce warriors. They tend to injured comrades, and now scientists have learned, they are careful strategists and genius navigators when it comes to raiding the nests of their arch enemy and main food source -- the termite.

Before launching their attacks, the ants send out teams of scouts to look for foraging sites. Once the recon ants pinpoint the location of the termite camp, they scramble back to headquarters to muster troops for the assault.

Here's the interesting part, according to Erik T. Frank, a scientist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland: the scout ants have an uncanny ability to navigate. They always take the quickest route back to headquarters, which may not be the shortest route. If the most direct road is blocked by dense grass or foliage, for example, the scout ants will turn on their onboard GPS systems (pheromones) and find the fastest detour through open terrain. As they do, the ants literally double time their speed, reducing the time it takes to return to their nests by an average of 35 percent.

The ants know that time is of the essence. The faster they return and rally their comrades, the more likely they will be able to pounce on the unsuspecting termites. Interestingly, the scouts do not make such decisions as a unit. Instead, one generalissimo plots the course.

""What's truly remarkable is that there is only one single ant that makes the decisions on what path to take and not a collective decision of many ants, which can also lead to the fastest path over consecutive runs and time (through pheromone trail reinforcement),"" Frank said in an email. ""This is the first time that such a complex time-optimized route integration system has been observed in individual ants.""

Upon their return, the scout ants lead the raiding party over the same territory they have just covered. Two hundred to 600 ants march off to battle, attacking and hauling their prey back to camp to be devoured. Frank and his colleagues observed that 59 percent of the time, the raids took place ""completely or partly on the road"" the scout ants determined was the quickest, instead of on the path that was the shortest distance.

Radiation therapy causes double-strand breaks in DNA that must be repaired for tumors to keep growing. Scientists have long theorized that if they could find a way to block repairs from being made, they could prevent tumors from growing or at least slow down the growth, thereby extending patients' survival. Blocking DNA repair is a particularly attractive strategy for treating glioblastomas, as these tumors are highly resistant to radiation therapy. In a study, UT Southwestern researchers demonstrated that the theory actually works in the context of glioblastomas.

""This work is informative because the findings show that blocking the repair of DNA double-strand breaks could be a viable option for improving radiation therapy of glioblastomas,"" said Dr. Sandeep Burma, Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology in the division of Molecular Radiation Biology at UT Southwestern.

His lab works on understanding basic mechanisms by which DNA breaks are repaired, with the translational objective of improving cancer therapy with DNA damaging agents. Recent research from his lab has demonstrated how a cell makes the choice between two major pathways that are used to repair DNA breaks -- non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). His lab found that enzymes involved in cell division called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activate HR by phosphorylating a key protein, EXO1. In this manner, the use of HR is coupled to the cell division cycle, and this has important implications for cancer therapeutics. These findings were published April 7 in Nature Communications.

While the above basic study describes how the cell chooses between NHEJ and HR, a translational study from the Burma lab demonstrates how blocking both repair pathways can improve radiotherapy of glioblastomas. Researchers in the lab first were able to show in glioblastoma cell lines that a drug called NVP-BEZ235, which is in clinical trials for other solid tumors, can also inhibit two key DNA repair enzymes, DNA-PKcs and ATM, which are crucial for NHEJ and HR, respectively. While the drug alone had limited effect, when combined with radiation therapy, the tumor cells could not quickly repair their DNA, stalling their growth.

While excited by the initial findings in cell lines, researchers remained cautious because previous efforts to identify DNA repair inhibitors had not succeded when used in living models -- mice with glioblastomas. Drugs developed to treat brain tumors also must cross what's known as the blood-brain-barrier in living models.

But the NVP-BEZ235 drug could successfully cross the blood-brain-barrier, and when administered to mice with glioblastomas and combined with radiation, the tumor growth in mice was slowed and the mice survived far longer -- up to 60 days compared to approximately 10 days with the drug or radiation therapy alone. These findings were published in the March 1 issue of Clinical Cancer Research.

""The consequence is striking,"" said Dr. Burma. ""If you irradiate the tumors, nothing much happens because they grow right through radiation. Give the drug alone, and again, nothing much happens. But when you give the two together, tumor growth is delayed significantly. The drug has a very striking synergistic effect when given with radiation.""

The combination effect is important because the standard therapy for glioblastomas in humans is radiation therapy, so finding a drug that improves the effectiveness of radiation therapy could have profound clinical importance eventually. For example, such drugs may permit lower doses of X-rays and gamma rays to be used for traditional therapies, thereby causing fewer side effects.

""Radiation is still the mainstay of therapy, so we have to have something that will work with the mainstay of therapy,"" Dr. Burma said.

While the findings provide proof that the concept of ""radiosensitizing"" glioblastomas works in mouse models, additional research and clinical trials will be needed to demonstrate whether the combination of radiation with DNA repair inhibitors would be effective in humans, Dr. Burma cautioned.

""Double-strand DNA breaks are a double-edged sword,"" he said. ""On one hand, they cause cancer. On the other, we use ionizing radiation and chemotherapy to cause double-strand breaks to treat the disease.""

Another recent publication from his lab highlights this apparent paradox by demonstrating how radiation can actually trigger glioblastomas in mouse models. This research, supported by NASA, is focused on understanding cancer risks from particle radiation, the type faced by astronauts on deep-space missions and now being used in cutting-edge cancer therapies such as proton and carbon ion therapy.

Dr. Burma's lab uses the high-tech facilities and large particle accelerator of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York to generate heavy ions, which can be used to irradiate glioblastoma-prone mice to test both the cancer-inducing potential of particle radiation as well as its potential therapeutic use.

""Heavy particles cause dense tracks of damage, which are very hard to repair,"" Dr. Burma noted. ""With gamma or X-rays, which are used in medical therapy, the damage is diffuse and is repaired within a day. If you examine a mouse brain irradiated with heavy particles, the damage is repaired slowly and can last for months.""

These findings, published March 17 in Oncogene, suggest that glioblastoma risk from heavier particles is much higher compared to that from gamma or X-rays. This study is relevant to the medical field, since ionizing radiation, even low doses from CT scans, have been reported to increase the risk of brain tumors, Dr. Burma said.",10,0.8333333333333334,1,0.08333333333333333,Blocking DNA repair mechanisms could improve radiation therapy for deadly brain cancer,"UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers have demonstrated in both cancer cell lines and in mice that blocking critical DNA repair mechanisms could improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy for highly fatal brain tumors called glioblastomas.

While excited by the initial findings in cell lines, researchers remained cautious because previous efforts to identify DNA repair inhibitors had not succeded when used in living models -- mice with glioblastomas. Drugs developed to treat brain tumors also must cross what's known as the blood-brain-barrier in living models.

But the NVP-BEZ235 drug could successfully cross the blood-brain-barrier, and when administered to mice with glioblastomas and combined with radiation, the tumor growth in mice was slowed and the mice survived far longer -- up to 60 days compared to approximately 10 days with the drug or radiation therapy alone. These findings were published in the March 1 issue of Clinical Cancer Research.

""The consequence is striking,"" said Dr. Burma. ""If you irradiate the tumors, nothing much happens because they grow right through radiation. Give the drug alone, and again, nothing much happens. But when you give the two together, tumor growth is delayed significantly. The drug has a very striking synergistic effect when given with radiation.""

The combination effect is important because the standard therapy for glioblastomas in humans is radiation therapy, so finding a drug that improves the effectiveness of radiation therapy could have profound clinical importance eventually. For example, such drugs may permit lower doses of X-rays and gamma rays to be used for traditional therapies, thereby causing fewer side effects.

""Radiation is still the mainstay of therapy, so we have to have something that will work with the mainstay of therapy,"" Dr. Burma said.

While the findings provide proof that the concept of ""radiosensitizing"" glioblastomas works in mouse models, additional research and clinical trials will be needed to demonstrate whether the combination of radiation with DNA repair inhibitors would be effective in humans, Dr. Burma cautioned.

""Double-strand DNA breaks are a double-edged sword,"" he said. ""On one hand, they cause cancer. On the other, we use ionizing radiation and chemotherapy to cause double-strand breaks to treat the disease.""

Another recent publication from his lab highlights this apparent paradox by demonstrating how radiation can actually trigger glioblastomas in mouse models. This research, supported by NASA, is focused on understanding cancer risks from particle radiation, the type faced by astronauts on deep-space missions and now being used in cutting-edge cancer therapies such as proton and carbon ion therapy.

Dr. Burma's lab uses the high-tech facilities and large particle accelerator of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York to generate heavy ions, which can be used to irradiate glioblastoma-prone mice to test both the cancer-inducing potential of particle radiation as well as its potential therapeutic use.

""Heavy particles cause dense tracks of damage, which are very hard to repair,"" Dr. Burma noted. ""With gamma or X-rays, which are used in medical therapy, the damage is diffuse and is repaired within a day.

Radiation therapy causes double-strand breaks in DNA that must be repaired for tumors to keep growing. Scientists have long theorized that if they could find a way to block repairs from being made, they could prevent tumors from growing or at least slow down the growth, thereby extending patients' survival. Blocking DNA repair is a particularly attractive strategy for treating glioblastomas, as these tumors are highly resistant to radiation therapy. In a study, UT Southwestern researchers demonstrated that the theory actually works in the context of glioblastomas.

""This work is informative because the findings show that blocking the repair of DNA double-strand breaks could be a viable option for improving radiation therapy of glioblastomas,"" said Dr. Sandeep Burma, Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology in the division of Molecular Radiation Biology at UT Southwestern.

His lab works on understanding basic mechanisms by which DNA breaks are repaired, with the translational objective of improving cancer therapy with DNA damaging agents. Recent research from his lab has demonstrated how a cell makes the choice between two major pathways that are used to repair DNA breaks - non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). His lab found that enzymes involved in cell division called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activate HR by phosphorylating a key protein, EXO1. In this manner, the use of HR is coupled to the cell division cycle, and this has important implications for cancer therapeutics. These findings were published April 7 in Nature Communications.

While the above basic study describes how the cell chooses between NHEJ and HR, a translational study from the Burma lab demonstrates how blocking both repair pathways can improve radiotherapy of glioblastomas. Researchers in the lab first were able to show in glioblastoma cell lines that a drug called NVP-BEZ235, which is in clinical trials for other solid tumors, can also inhibit two key DNA repair enzymes, DNA-PKcs and ATM, which are crucial for NHEJ and HR, respectively.

Scientists have long theorized that if they could find a way to block repairs from being made, they could prevent tumors from growing or at least slow down the growth, thereby extending patients' survival. Blocking DNA repair is a particularly attractive strategy for treating glioblastomas, as these tumors are highly resistant to radiation therapy. In a study, UT Southwestern researchers demonstrated that the theory actually works in the context of glioblastomas.<br><br>""This work is informative because the findings show that blocking the repair of DNA double-strand breaks could be a viable option for improving radiation therapy of glioblastomas,"" said Dr. Sandeep Burma, Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology in the division of Molecular Radiation Biology at UT Southwestern.<br><br>His lab works on understanding basic mechanisms by which DNA breaks are repaired, with the translational objective of improving cancer therapy with DNA damaging agents. Recent research from his lab has demonstrated how a cell makes the choice between two major pathways that are used to repair DNA breaks - non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). His lab found that enzymes involved in cell division called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activate HR by phosphorylating a key protein, EXO1. In this manner, the use of HR is coupled to the cell division cycle, and this has important implications for cancer therapeutics. These findings were published April 7 in Nature Communications.<br><br>While the above basic study describes how the cell chooses between NHEJ and HR, a translational study from the Burma lab demonstrates how blocking both repair pathways can improve radiotherapy of glioblastomas. Researchers in the lab first were able to show in glioblastoma cell lines that a drug called NVP-BEZ235, which is in clinical trials for other solid tumors, can also inhibit two key DNA repair enzymes, DNA-PKcs and ATM, which are crucial for NHEJ and HR, respectively. While the drug alone had limited effect, when combined with radiation therapy, the tumor cells could not quickly repair their DNA, stalling their growth.<br><br>While excited by the initial findings in cell lines, researchers remained cautious because previous efforts to identify DNA repair inhibitors had not succeded when used in living models - mice with glioblastomas. Drugs developed to treat brain tumors also must cross what's known as the blood-brain-barrier in living models.<br><br>But the NVP-BEZ235 drug could successfully cross the blood-brain-barrier, and when administered to mice with glioblastomas and combined with radiation, the tumor growth in mice was slowed and the mice survived far longer - up to 60 days compared to approximately 10 days with the drug or radiation therapy alone. These findings were published in the March 1 issue of Clinical Cancer Research.<br><br>""The consequence is striking,"" said Dr. Burma. ""If you irradiate the tumors, nothing much happens because they grow right through radiation. Give the drug alone, and again, nothing much happens. But when you give the two together, tumor growth is delayed significantly. The drug has a very striking synergistic effect when given with radiation.""<br><br>The combination effect is important because the standard therapy for glioblastomas in humans is radiation therapy, so finding a drug that improves the effectiveness of radiation therapy could have profound clinical importance eventually. For example, such drugs may permit lower doses of X-rays and gamma rays to be used for traditional therapies, thereby causing fewer side effects.<br><br>""Radiation is still the mainstay of therapy, so we have to have something that will work with the mainstay of therapy,"" Dr. Burma said.<br><br>While the findings provide proof that the concept of ""radiosensitizing"" glioblastomas works in mouse models, additional research and clinical trials will be needed to demonstrate whether the combination of radiation with DNA repair inhibitors would be effective in humans, Dr. Burma cautioned.<br><br>""Double-strand DNA breaks are a double-edged sword,"" he said. ""On one hand, they cause cancer. On the other, we use ionizing radiation and chemotherapy to cause double-strand breaks to treat the disease.""<br><br>Another recent publication from his lab highlights this apparent paradox by demonstrating how radiation can actually trigger glioblastomas in mouse models. This research, supported by NASA, is focused on understanding cancer risks from particle radiation, the type faced by astronauts on deep-space missions and now being used in cutting-edge cancer therapies such as proton and carbon ion therapy.<br><br>Dr. Burma's lab uses the high-tech facilities and large particle accelerator of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York to generate heavy ions, which can be used to irradiate glioblastoma-prone mice to test both the cancer-inducing potential of particle radiation as well as its potential therapeutic use.<br><br>""Heavy particles cause dense tracks of damage, which are very hard to repair,"" Dr. Burma noted. ""With gamma or X-rays, which are used in medical therapy, the damage is diffuse and is repaired within a day. If you examine a mouse brain irradiated with heavy particles, the damage is repaired slowly and can last for months.""<br><br>These findings, published March 17 in Oncogene, suggest that glioblastoma risk from heavier particles is much higher compared to that from gamma or X-rays. This study is relevant to the medical field, since ionizing radiation, even low doses from CT scans, have been reported to increase the risk of brain tumors, Dr. Burma said.<br><br>The first authors of these publications are instructor Dr. Nozomi Tomimatsu (Nature Communications), graduate student, Carlos Gil Del Alcazar (Clinical Cancer Research) and former graduate student Dr. Cristel Camacho (Oncogene). Other Burma lab members who contributed to these publications include assistant professor Bipasha Mukherjee, and graduate students Pavlina Todorova, Mariya Ilcheva and Molly Catherine Hardebeck.

June 5 (UPI) -- Most people addicted to opioids want safe places to use those drugs, a new survey shows.

Roughly 77 percent of people in Baltimore, Boston and Providence, R.I., addicted to heroin, fentanyl and illicit opioid pills want safe injection facilities and overdose prevention sites, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Urban Health.

""On the whole, we found a strong willingness to use safe consumption spaces. This is important because often the voices of people who use drugs are not always included in policy debates or in the implementation of public health interventions,"" Ju Nyeong Park, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University and study lead author, said in a news release.

The researchers surveyed 326 people who participated in syringe participation programs and other places throughout Baltimore, Boston and Providence. About 70 percent of the group were homeless, and 60 percent regularly used drugs in ""public or semi-public places.""

More than a third of the opioid users said they had overdosed in the past six months, while 73 percent reported recently consuming a drug that contained fentanyl. The substance is used to enhance the potency of drugs like heroin, making an overdose more likely.

Concerns of community blight and endorsement of illegal drug use have caused many people to push back against safe spaces, the researcher says. Yet, politicians are considering it as a viable option to combat the opioid epidemic. According to the study, more than 70,000 overdose deaths occurred in 2017.

Many people point to the success safe spaces have had in other countries in slowing down the transmission of HIV and Hepatitis B and C viruses.

Still, the United States currently has no legal safe consumption spaces because of a federal law known as the ""crack house statute"" that prohibits anyone from providing property for illegal drug use.

However, even if safe places were legal, many people would refuse to use them due to the potential consequences. About 38 percent of opioid users would fear being arrested and 36 percent would worry about privacy concerns if they used a safe place, according to the researchers.

A majority of people who use opioid drugs would willingly use safe consumption spaces, a new study reports.

The United States currently has no such facilities where users could receive sterile syringes and, in case of overdose, medical support.

Researchers surveyed more than 300 people who use heroin, fentanyl, and illicit opioid pills in Baltimore, Boston, and Providence, Rhode Island. About 77 percent of participants reported a willingness to use safe consumption spaces. Canada, Australia, and other countries have set up and evaluated these types of sites.

""This study is an important first step in exploration of safe consumption spaces in these three cities,"" says Traci Green, an associate professor of emergency medicine and epidemiology at Brown University and Boston University and senior author of the paper in the Journal of Urban Health.

""Rigorous and measured scientific approaches to new innovations like safe consumption spaces can help inform policy and better equip public health responses to the opioid crisis.""

Safe consumption spaces, also called safe injection facilities and overdose prevention sites, are a proven method to reduce the harms stemming from opioid use disorders, according to the study. Countries outside the US have used them for more than 30 years.

However, there are no legal safe consumption spaces in the US due in part to a federal law that creates a serious criminal liability for anyone knowingly connected with a property for illegal drug use, researchers say.

Policymakers in Rhode Island and a few other states are pursuing legislation to make safe consumption spaces viable options for stemming the ongoing opioid overdose epidemic.

The researchers surveyed 326 people in Providence, Boston, and Baltimore who said they had used opioids non-medically in the past 30 days. Of those surveyed, 68 percent of the Providence participants, 84 percent of the Boston participants, and 78 percent of the Baltimore participants said they were willing to use a safe consumption space.

Willingness to use these spaces was even higher--84 percent--among people who primarily used opioids in public spaces such as streets, parks, and abandoned buildings, according to the study.

When asked what could hinder use of a safe space, 38 percent said fear of arrest and 36 percent pointed to privacy concerns.

Of the people surveyed, almost 70 percent were homeless, and 60 percent reported habitually using drugs in public or semi-public places. More than a third reported having experienced an overdose in the past six months, and 73 percent reported recent use of a drug they suspected had contained fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is much more potent than heroin and implicated in an increasing number of fatal overdoses.

""On the whole, we found a strong willingness to use safe consumption spaces,"" says lead author Ju Nyeong Park, an assistant scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""It's encouraging because even though these are people engaging in very high-risk behaviors in very different contexts within these three cities, they were willing to use this harm-reduction intervention.""

Additional authors are from Brown and Johns Hopkins. The Bloomberg American Health Initiative and the National Institutes of Health supported the work.

Anyway, Phil makes his annual prediction at 8:30 a.m., a half-hour after the more famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, makes his. And coincidentally, the two Phils have made the same predictions for the past six years, reports the Washington Post in an article titled ""A Groundhog Day Scandal? Potomac Phil Denies Rumors of Collusion."" When theorists began to allege that Potomac Phil was a copycat, his handler, Aaron DeNu, made a statement. ""There has been no collusion between Potomac Phil and Punxsutawney Phil,"" he says. ""Absolutely no collusion."" Instead, DeNu says he has a methodological way of translating Phil's predictions. ""I look at his facial expressions, posture, and intensity, the glare and gaze in his eyes,"" he says. And definitely not Punxsutawney Phil's earlier forecast.

It's been a bad week for Republicans, many of whom expressed outrage at President Donald Trump for refusing to admonish Russian president Vladimir Putin for reportedly meddling in the 2016 elections. But, according to a recent study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, conservatives around the globe have the upper hand when it comes to at least one thing: compared to liberals, they're more likely to find their lives meaningful.

Psychologists at the University of Southern California analyzed studies from 16 countries in which thousands of people were asked to rank their political ideology on a scale of 1 to 7--ranging from ""extremely conservative"" to ""extremely liberal""--then rate the degree to which they agreed with statements such as ""I understand my life's meaning"" and ""My life has a real purpose.""

According to the study's abstract, the results found that, overall, ""conservatives reported greater meaning and purpose in life than liberals at each reporting period.""

While this is purely conjecture, the researchers have two theories on why those on the right wing end of the spectrum might feel more ontologically satisfied than those on the left.

The first was that the country's current state of progress is moving in the direction of their beliefs and values.

""Finding meaning in life is related to the sense or feeling that things are the way they should be, and that there is a sense of order,"" David Newman, a doctoral candidate at USC Dornsife's Mind and Society Center and lead author of the study, said in a statement. ""If life feels chaotic, then that would likely dampen your sense that life is meaningful.""

But that explanation only applies to America, and even then it's a weak one, since the study covered materials spanning four decades.

Another possible reason for this disparity could be tied to faith, since conservatives tend to be more religious than liberals, and some studies have found that people with religious affiliations tend to live longer, happier lives. But the researchers said that, even when they adjusted the results according to faith, there still seemed to be a link between right-wing ideology and sense of purpose.

That said, Newman cautioned that the study does not necessarily mean that ""every conservative finds a lot of meaning in their life and that every liberal is depressed,"" especially since there are a variety of factors that affect your sense of purpose, from your personality traits, to your mood, to how much sleep you get. Not to mention that the study did not say that liberals find their lives completely devoid of meaning, so much as they are still searching for it.

Still, given that viewing your life as meaningful is a crucial part of being happy, it's worth considering the reason for this partisan divide, especially since a recent Gallup poll found that the happiness levels of Americans are at the lowest they've been since they first started collecting the data in 2008. And while Finland got the top score in this year's World Happiness Report, the United States fell to a historic low, coming in 18th place.

It's been a bad week for Republicans, many of whom expressed outrage at President Donald Trump for refusing to admonish Russian president Vladimir Putin for reportedly meddling in the 2016 elections. But, according to a recent study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, conservatives around the globe have the upper hand when it comes to at least one thing: compared to liberals, they're more likely to find their lives meaningful.

Psychologists at the University of Southern California analyzed studies from 16 countries in which thousands of people were asked to rank their political ideology on a scale of 1 to 7--ranging from ""extremely conservative"" to ""extremely liberal""--then rate the degree to which they agreed with statements such as ""I understand my life's meaning"" and ""My life has a real purpose.""

According to the study's abstract, the results found that, overall, ""conservatives reported greater meaning and purpose in life than liberals at each reporting period.""

While this is purely conjecture, the researchers have two theories on why those on the right wing end of the spectrum might feel more ontologically satisfied than those on the left.

The first was that the country's current state of progress is moving in the direction of their beliefs and values.

""Finding meaning in life is related to the sense or feeling that things are the way they should be, and that there is a sense of order,"" David Newman, a doctoral candidate at USC Dornsife's Mind and Society Center and lead author of the study, said in a statement. ""If life feels chaotic, then that would likely dampen your sense that life is meaningful.""

But that explanation only applies to America, and even then it's a weak one, since the study covered materials spanning four decades.

Another possible reason for this disparity could be tied to faith, since conservatives tend to be more religious than liberals, and some studies have found that people with religious affiliations tend to live longer, happier lives. But the researchers said that, even when they adjusted the results according to faith, there still seemed to be a link between right-wing ideology and sense of purpose.

That said, Newman cautioned that the study does not necessarily mean that ""every conservative finds a lot of meaning in their life and that every liberal is depressed,"" especially since there are a variety of factors that affect your sense of purpose, from your personality traits, to your mood, to how much sleep you get.

The results, published on June 15 in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, were based on five studies examining how strongly conservatives and liberals feel that their lives have purpose.

Belief in God

The scientists analyzed results from two nationally-representative samples and three additional samples in which well-being was assessed in various forms. Altogether, these studies encompassed thousands of participants from 16 countries and spanned four decades.

Participants usually ranked their political ideology on a scale from one to seven, ranging from ""extremely conservative"" to ""extremely liberal."" They also rated how much they agreed or disagreed with statements such as ""my life has a real purpose"" and ""I understand my life's meaning.""

The psychologists were aware that religious belief may be a factor and adjusted the results to account for it. Even then, the association between political leanings and sense of purpose held strong.

The results suggest ""that there is some unique aspect of political conservatism that provides people with meaning and purpose in life,"" the scientists wrote.

What does your lean mean?

Newman cautioned against making conclusions about anyone's state of mind and overall well-being based solely on their political leanings.

""It doesn't mean that every conservative finds a lot of meaning in their life and that every liberal is depressed,"" Newman said.

Meaning is personal to each of us. However, a new study published June 15 in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science suggests that some people might be better at finding that meaning than others -- and the difference may come down to politics.

According to the study, which compiled survey results from more than 50,000 participants in 16 countries, people who identified as political conservatives were more likely to find meaning and satisfaction in their lives than liberals were.

""Political conservatives tend to be happier than liberals, a finding that has been labeled the 'happiness gap' in media reporting,"" a team of psychologists from the University of Southern California (USC) wrote in the new paper. ""One conservative commentator even described it as 'niftily self-reinforcing; it depresses liberals.'"" [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]

Vote red or feel blue?

In the new study, researchers split the idea of happiness into two facets: day-to-day satisfaction and an overall sense of meaning in life.

To see how strongly these concepts contributed to the happiness gap between liberals and conservatives, the USC researchers compiled the results of five different psychological surveys administered between 1981 and 2017. Each survey asked participants to state their opinions on various political issues and to answer some version of the questions ""Do you feel your life has meaning?"" and ""How satisfied are you with your life?""

The difference the researchers saw wasn't huge, but it was consistent. Across all five surveys, people who identified as having conservative political beliefs were more likely to report stronger feelings of meaning and satisfaction in life than liberals were. The pattern held true whether participants were asked to assess their satisfaction with the previous 24 hours or to look at their lives as a whole.

Why might this be? Surprisingly, God wasn't the answer. Even when the researchers adjusted their statistical model to take religious attendance out of the equation, conservatives still proved more satisfied and purposeful than liberals.

One clue came from identifying whether a respondent's views were more socially or economically conservative. ""Social conservatism (in form of opposition to abortion and gay marriage) was a better predictor of meaning in life than economic conservatism, whereas the reverse was true for life satisfaction,"" the authors wrote.

The researchers said this split neatly reflects the two main components of conservative ideology: a rationalization of inequality and the resistance to change.

If it ain't broke, don't fix anything

The link between life satisfaction and economic beliefs is easy enough to grasp. Financial well-being makes life less stressful, and previous studies have found that conservatives are less moved by the inequality experienced by others than liberals are. One 2008 study found that as income inequality increased in the United States from the 1970s to the early 2000s, the happiness gap between conservatives and liberals also increased. Experts think that people who identify as economic conservatives are more likely to believe that some people deserve to be rich, others deserve to be poor and the system that made society that way is fair, the study suggested.

And what about the link between a meaningful life and resistance to change? It may be as simple as a matter of order, said David Newman, author of the new study and a doctoral candidate at the USC Dornsife's Mind and Society Center.

""Finding meaning in life is related to the sense or feeling that things are the way they should be and that there is a sense of order,"" Newman said in a statement. ""If life feels chaotic, then that would likely dampen your sense that life is meaningful.""

Of course, this interpretation is all conjectural, Newman wrote in the study, and the link could ultimately be a matter of circumstance. For example, some common factor in the study participants' childhoods could have led them to independently develop conservative viewpoints as well as feelings of satisfaction and purpose later on.

Still, across more than 50,000 survey responses, a clear meaning-of-life gap showed up, and that's worth investigating more, Newman and his colleagues wrote.

To paraphrase the great Kermit once again, it's not easy being green... but apparently, it's a little easier (or at least more satisfying) being red.

Sea surface temperatures (SST) are projected to increase in most of the world's oceans as the result of global climate change. However, within an area of rotating ocean currents just south of Greenland an anomaly exists where colder sea-surface temperatures were documented in both global climate-model projections and in observations.

""It's called a hole because there is a lack of warming,"" said Melissa Gervais, assistant professor of meteorology and atmospheric science, Penn State, who used the Community Earth System model (CESM) to investigate the impact of the NAWH on atmospheric circulation and midlatitude jets. ""We found that this region of the ocean is a really important place for forcing the jet stream that goes across the North Atlantic Ocean.""

The researchers published their findings in the Journal of Climate.

Development of the NAWH is linked to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a large system of ocean currents that carry warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic, and is thought to be caused by an influx of fresh water coming from melting Arctic sea ice.

Previous research by Gervais and her team demonstrated that this increase in fresh water to the ocean changes circulation patterns and leads to surface cooling.

""With more Arctic sea ice melting, more fresh water flows into the Labrador Sea, which leads to a reduction in deep convection,"" said Gervais who also is an Institute for CyberScience co-hire. ""That changes the ocean circulation, allowing it to cool in that region south of Greenland.""

This cooling pattern, relative to global average SST increase, is predicted to become greater and more apparent relative to the internal ocean variability as the 21st century progresses.

""These changes in SST patterns occur as the result of changes in ocean circulation and could have a significant impact on atmospheric circulation and the North Atlantic storm track in the future,"" said Gervais.

Jet streams, high altitude currents of wind flowing above the Earth, transport air masses and drive weather patterns. The relationship between climate change and jet streams is complex and understanding the potential impact of climate change on jet streams is crucial for understanding changes in weather patterns and storm tracks.

""With climate change we have some ideas about how the jets are going to change. In general, we expect to see a poleward shift and eastward elongation of the jet,"" said Gervais. ""Right now, it's sort of a tug of war between impacts of the tropics and impacts of the arctic. So those two things are competing to shift where the jet is located.""

Most climate models seem to agree that the Pacific jet stream is going to shift poleward but there is a lot of variability in predictions for the Atlantic, said Gervais.

To investigate how the development of the NAWH impacts the jet stream, the team conducted a series of large-ensemble, atmospheric model experiments in the CESM with prescribed SST and sea ice levels over three different time periods.

""We ran three simulations,"" said Gervais. ""One with current warming-hole conditions; one where the ocean temperature was increased to fill in the warming hole; and one where its size was twice as deep, to simulate more freshwater from melting ice sheets.""

Their results indicate that the NAWH plays an important role in midlatitude atmospheric circulation changes in the model's future climate simulations.

""We found that it's really quite important for that region,"" said Gervais. ""The NAWH seems to be elongating the jet even further and shifting it a little bit north. Instead of just thinking about how the tropics and arctic amplification are influencing the jet, we now also need to think about how this warming hole is going to influence the jet. These local changes in the North Atlantic jet are of a similar magnitude to the full climate-change response in the region, indicating that the North Atlantic warming hole could be an important additional factor in the tug of war on midlatitude circulation, that has received little attention.""",2,0.16666666666666666,0,0.0,North Atlantic warming hole impacts jet stream -- ScienceDaily,"The North Atlantic warming hole (NAWH), a region of reduced warming located in the North Atlantic Ocean, significantly affects the North Atlantic jet stream in climate simulations of the future, according to a team of researchers.

One of the projected consequences of the global climate change is the increase in the sea surface temperatures. However, colder sea-surface temperatures were documented in both global climate-model projections and observations within an area of rotating ocean currents just south of Greenland.

The results of the study were published in the Journal of Climate.

""It's called a hole because there is a lack of warming,"" said Melissa Gervais, assistant professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State.

""We found that this region of the ocean is a really important place for forcing the jet stream that goes across the North Atlantic Ocean.""

Gervais used the Community Earth System model to investigate the impact of the North Atlantic warming hole on atmospheric circulation and midlatitude jets.

Melting Arctic Ice

The inundation of fresh water coming from melting Arctic sea ice is originally thought to be the cause of the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Apparently, the development of the North Atlantic warming hole is a major factor.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is a large system of ocean currents that carry warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic.

Preliminary research done by Gervais suggests that the more fresh water enters the ocean, the more it leads to surface cooling and changes in circulation patterns.

Gervais adds that the changes in SST patterns could have a major contribution on atmospheric circulation and the North Atlantic storm track in the future.

Climate Change And Jet Streams

Currently, scientists are concerned about the changes in storm tracks and weather patterns based on the relationship between jet streams and climate change. Jet streams are responsible for driving weather patterns and transporting air masses on the planet.

Although Gervais and her team expect a poleward shift and eastward elongation of the jet streams, there is a present tug-of-war between impacts of the arctic and impacts of the tropics.

The researchers ran simulations to explore how the development of the North Atlantic warming hole impacts the jet stream. Their results indicate that the NAWH plays an important role in midlatitude atmospheric circulation changes in the model's future climate simulations.

The U.S. Department of Energy and The National Science Foundation sponsored the research.

A new paper looks into how ideas about ""naturalness"" play into opinions about genetically engineered food.

""It's an overview of where we are,"" says Sydney Scott, assistant professor of marketing in the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis, who previously published research on the ""moralization"" of genetically modified foods and the role of consumer ""disgust"" in their consumption.

""It's looking at the state of what's been done in the regulatory landscape and the research in understanding attitudes,"" Scott says.

Still 'grossed out'

The upshot of the team's work is that after more than 20 years of growth in genetic engineering in agriculture, consumers have largely remained skeptical, even to the point of being ""grossed out"" by the idea.

""In some contexts, people view nature and naturalness as sacred and genetically engineered food as a violation of naturalness,"" the paper's authors write. The prevailing research also shows that consumers follow ""the magical law of contagion""--the idea that the slightest contact between natural foods and something else contaminates it. Thus, a housefly's wing in a bowl of soup renders the entire serving inedible.

What the research overview doesn't address, however, is why some consumers seem to be fine with heavily processed foods--Hamburger Helper, frozen microwave dinners, or maple-flavored ""pancake syrup""--but cannot abide genetically engineered foods such as weed-resistant soybeans, vitamin A-enriched rice, or fast-growing salmon.

""Consumers seem to be saying it's not OK to poke into the DNA. That's yucky,"" Scott says. ""People are grossed out by that.""

Scott says the Annual Review commissioned the research findings overview. ""We were hoping it would provide a useful synthesis of what we know to a broad audience--the risks and benefits of this technology, what people think, and why?--and highlight the importance of this pro-naturalness context.""

Changes to the food landscape

Through their review of the literature, the researchers note that prior work identified four governmental approaches to regulating genetically modified crops, including promotional, permissive, precautionary, and preventative. For example, the United States tends to have a permissive approach, grows a lot of genetically modified crops, and says they are ""generally recognized as safe.""

By contrast, the European Union is restrictive in its approach, allowing only two genetically engineered crops to be grown commercially--potatoes and maize--and even those are not grown for human consumption ""due to consumer resistance,"" according to the research paper.

Yet globally, the increase in genetically engineered crops has grown to cover half of US cropland and 12 percent of total cropland--mostly in North and South America and Asia. At the same time, worldwide sales of organic food have climbed from about $15.2 billion in 1999 to $90 billion in 2016.

A key aim of the research team's work was to expose the gap between advocates of genetically engineered foods and opponents.

""This won't be solved by just taking into account the scientific information,"" which shows genetically engineered foods have no adverse effects on the environment or human health, Scott says.

""When we're communicating with people about this technology, to have a successful conversation, we have to realize that,"" she adds.

""What we're trying to figure out now is what will allow people to reach a better consensus. I don't think it's insurmountable.""

The paper appears in the Annual Review of Nutrition.

June 13 (UPI) -- Substance abuse resulting from ""deaths of despair"" may not be to blame for declining life expectancy in the United States, a new study says.

New research argues poorer, less educated white adults are dying much earlier than more affluent white adults from internal diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancers, according to research published Thursday Journal of Health and Social Behavior.

Life expectancy, the time a person is expected to live, went down from 78.7 years in 2016 to 78.6 in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number remained unchanged for women, but dropped from 76.2 to 76.1 for men.

Many researchers have attributed this dip in life expectancy to the opioid crisis.

""The assumption that people are giving up neglects the existing research that shows the engaged and tenacious ways people often deal with life challenges,"" Arline Geronimus, a researcher at University of Michigan and study lead author, said in a news release.

For the study, the researchers analyzed deaths caused by opioids, cardiovascular disease, HIV, and lung or other cancers for non-Hispanic blacks and whites from 1990 to 2015. They ranked the people who died by education level and gender.

""These findings suggest that, rather than giving up in the face of hopelessness, less-educated Americans may be losing ground for exactly the opposite reason -- because they work so hard, they bear the health consequences of years of stress,"" Geronimus said.

The researchers found deaths of despair -- those resulting from drug overdose, suicide and alcohol-related liver diseases -- widened the death inequality among white people with higher and lower education levels, particularly among men. Meanwhile, black people didn't have the same disparity, they said.

In recent years, some studies have claimed the economic downturn in the United States has led to Americans to using more drugs and alcohol, and committing suicide, in higher numbers, leading to a fall in overall life expectancy.

Geronimus says targeted marketing of opioids to white communities, overprescription of the drugs by doctors and a spike in fentanyl use have played some part in life expectancy decline. And suicides don't contribute largely to the decline, either, Geronimus says.

Rather, deaths from cardiovascular disease, non-lung cancers and internal illnesses may be causing life expectancy gaps between more and less educated white people to grow more widely.

Some influential studies have argued that growing life expectancy inequality is driven by so-called ""deaths of despair,"" suggesting that economic stagnation has induced less-educated Americans to turn to drugs, alcohol and suicide.

Yet, that explanation is inconsistent with a large body of research on the way many disadvantaged Americans respond to stress, says Arline Geronimus, a professor at U-M's School of Public Health and lead author of the study published in the June issue of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior.

""The assumption that people are giving up neglects the existing research that shows the engaged and tenacious ways people often deal with life challenges,"" Geronimus said.

Geronimus and her team set out to look at whether the empirical data backed this concept. They used Census and Vital Statistics data to evaluate historically relevant causes of deaths -- including opioids, cardiovascular disease, HIV, and lung or other cancers -- for non-Hispanic blacks and whites between 1990 and 2015, ranking them by gender and education (less or more educated).

When looking at the deaths of despair (drug overdose, suicide and alcohol-related liver diseases), the researchers found that drug overdoses do contribute to the widening inequality for whites, especially men, but that's not the case for blacks. Also, they found that overdose deaths are less important for growing inequality in women's life expectancy.

For older adults, where the growth in inequality is largest, premature death due to cardiovascular disease and cancers are the main reason for the widening gap -- not overdose deaths. The early onset and progression of such chronic diseases can reflect the physiological impact of prolonged and resolute coping with life stressors, Geronimus says.

She points out that suicide rates have contributed little to the growing inequality gap, contrary to the ""deaths of despair"" theory. Instead, deaths due to cardiovascular disease, non-lung cancers and other internal diseases might help explain important shares of the growing life expectancy gap between those less educated and their highly educated counterparts, Geronimus says.

""These findings suggest that, rather than giving up in the face of hopelessness, less-educated Americans may be losing ground for exactly the opposite reason -- because they work so hard, they bear the health consequences of years of stress,"" she said.

As for the opioid epidemic, Geronimus says researchers should also consider how targeted marketing to white populations, overprescription of legal opioids by physicians, the increasing use of fentanyl in street drugs, and restricted access to life-saving resources have all contributed to the increase in inequality in life expectancy accounted for by opioid deaths in whites.

""The deaths of despair narrative is speculative, overlooks black lives and implies that lack of resilience explains the life expectancy inequities among whites, especially of those who have been socioeconomically disenfranchised,"" Geronimus said.

""While addressing the opioid epidemic is urgent, we should not lose sight of the widening educational mortality gap attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancers and other internal causes.""",1,0.2,0,0.0,Growing life expectancy inequality in US cannot be blamed on opioids alone,"A new University of Michigan study challenges a popularized view about what's causing the growing gap between the lifespans of more- and less-educated Americans -- finding shortcomings in the widespread narrative that the United States is facing an epidemic of ""despair.""

For older adults, where the growth in inequality is largest, premature death due to cardiovascular disease and cancers are the main reason for the widening gap -- not overdose deaths. The early onset and progression of such chronic diseases can reflect the physiological impact of prolonged and resolute coping with life stressors, Geronimus says.

She points out that suicide rates have contributed little to the growing inequality gap, contrary to the ""deaths of despair"" theory. Instead, deaths due to cardiovascular disease, non-lung cancers and other internal diseases might help explain important shares of the growing life expectancy gap between those less educated and their highly educated counterparts, Geronimus says.

""These findings suggest that, rather than giving up in the face of hopelessness, less-educated Americans may be losing ground for exactly the opposite reason -- because they work so hard, they bear the health consequences of years of stress,"" she said.

As for the opioid epidemic, Geronimus says researchers should also consider how targeted marketing to white populations, overprescription of legal opioids by physicians, the increasing use of fentanyl in street drugs, and restricted access to life-saving resources have all contributed to the increase in inequality in life expectancy accounted for by opioid deaths in whites.

""The deaths of despair narrative is speculative, overlooks black lives and implies that lack of resilience explains the life expectancy inequities among whites, especially of those who have been socioeconomically disenfranchised,"" Geronimus said.

""While addressing the opioid epidemic is urgent, we should not lose sight of the widening educational mortality gap attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancers and other internal causes.""",http://ct.moreover.com/?a=39453680633&p=1pl&v=1&x=Hd-Bt4tNTPxgyFiuOcVDNw,"<div style=""width: 1000px; height: 600px; overflow-y:scroll;""> Please read the following unpublished science news drafted by a journalist and rate the statements below <hr size=""10""> <strong>Title :Growing life expectancy inequality in US cannot be blamed on opioids alone</Strong> <br> <hr size=""2""> A new University of Michigan study challenges a popularized view about what's causing the growing gap between the lifespans of more- and less-educated Americans -- finding shortcomings in the widespread narrative that the United States is facing an epidemic of ""despair.""<br><br>Some influential studies have argued that growing life expectancy inequality is driven by so-called ""deaths of despair,"" suggesting that economic stagnation has induced less-educated Americans to turn to drugs, alcohol and suicide.<br><br>Yet, that explanation is inconsistent with a large body of research on the way many disadvantaged Americans respond to stress, says Arline Geronimus, a professor at U-M's School of Public Health and lead author of the study published in the June issue of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior.<br><br>""The assumption that people are giving up neglects the existing research that shows the engaged and tenacious ways people often deal with life challenges,"" Geronimus said.<br><br>Geronimus and her team set out to look at whether the empirical data backed this concept.

The re",0.3333333333333333,1,"An anti-cancer drug has been proven to be equally as effective in treating the most common cause of blindness in older adults as a more expensive drug specifically formulated for this purpose.

The results of a two-year trial, led by Queen's scientist Professor Usha Chakravarthy, and published in The Lancet today (Friday 19 July), show that two drug treatments Lucentis and Avastin are equally effective in treating neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).

Wet AMD is a common cause of sight loss in older people with at least 23,000 older people diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year. Without treatment two thirds of people with this condition will experience severe loss of sight within two years of being diagnosed.

Lucentis, the drug most commonly used in the UK at present to treat wet AMD, costs about PS700 per injection and Avastin costs about PS60 per injection. The NHS could save PS84.5 million annually based on injecting 17,295 eyes each year by switching from Lucentis to Avastin. Avastin is already used to treat wet AMD in some parts of the UK and extensively elsewhere in the world and also for other eye conditions.

Over the past five years, a team of scientists and eye specialists from 23 hospitals and UK universities, including Queen's University Belfast, University of Bristol, University of Liverpool, University of Southampton and University of Oxford, have investigated whether Lucentis and Avastin and the way they are given are equally effective and safe.

610 people with wet AMD entered a two-year trial known as IVAN which is one of the largest ever carried out in the field of eye disease in the UK. Patients received injections of the drug into the affected eye every month for the first three months. Patients were then subdivided to receive the injections at every visit (monthly group) or only if the specialist decided there was persistent disease activity (as needed group).

The IVAN study's two year results show that sight was equally well preserved with either of the two drugs. Giving the treatment regularly every month, resulted in slightly better levels of sight which was detected through testing of near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The 'as needed' group received on average 13 injections over the two year period compared to 23 for the monthly treatment group. However, continuous treatment caused a higher proportion of eyes to develop a condition known as geographic atrophy which is a thinning of the retina and its blood supply.

Professor Usha Chakravarthy of Queen's University Belfast's Centre for Vision and Vascular Science, who led the research study team said: ""The IVAN results at the end of year two show that Lucentis and Avastin have similar functional effectiveness regardless of the drug received. With respect to monthly versus as needed treatment, while there was marginally better eyesight in the former, the development of atrophy is a matter of concern in the longer term.""

The IVAN study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust sponsored the clinical trial. Professor Ian Young, Director of Research and Development at the Trust said: ""The findings of the IVAN study will be of great importance for the management of patients with wet AMD throughout the world. Research to improve patient care is a key aspect of the work of Belfast Trust, and we are committed to sponsoring and leading important clinical trials of this kind which allow our patients early access to new treatments.""

Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, Health and Social Care Research and Development Division of the Public Health Agency, which supported the trial said: ""With increasing life expectancy and a growing proportion of older people in the population, slowing the progress of conditions like AMD is key to maintaining their independence. The IVAN trial is an example of research led from Northern Ireland with international significance -- the findings have the potential to influence how AMD is managed in the future.""

The IVAN study also monitored the drugs for serious adverse events which included death, heart attacks, strokes, and any other event that was life threatening, disabling or resulted in hospitalisation. These were similar for the two drugs. However, deaths occurred less frequently in the group that received monthly treatment, although there were fewer deaths overall among people taking part in the trial than were expected based on their age and gender and national death rates. When these safety results were combined with those of a similar study called the CATT trial which was performed in the USA, the resultant findings continued to indicate fewer deaths when treatment was given monthly.

The researchers state that their findings will be of relevance to the next round of technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and could lead to important changes to the way wet AMD is treated. In the meantime, for an older person starting a course of Lucentis or Avastin, it will be important to explain the trade-off between the number of injections, and the chances of developing geographic atrophy and risk of mortality in two years.",6,0.6666666666666666,0,0.0,Cheaper anti-cancer drug as effective as expensive drug in treating most common cause of blindness in older adults,"An anti-cancer drug has been proven to be equally as effective in treating the most common cause of blindness in older adults as a more expensive drug specifically formulated for this purpose.

Scientists at the Universities of Liverpool, Belfast, Bristol, Southampton and Oxford, have shown that an anti-cancer drug is equally as effective in treating the most common cause of blindness as a more expensive drug specifically formulated for this purpose.

The results from the IVAN research study, published in the Lancet, show that two drug treatments, Lucentis and Avastin, are equally effective in treating neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).

Common cause of sight loss

Wet AMD is a common cause of sight loss in older people with at least 23,000 diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year. Without treatment two thirds of people with this condition will experience severe loss of sight within two years of being diagnosed.

Over the past five years, a team of scientists and eye specialists from 23 UK hospitals and universities have investigated whether Lucentis and Avastin, and the way they are administered, are equally effective and safe.

The NHS could save PS84.5 million annually, based on injecting 17,295 eyes each year by switching from Lucentis to Avastin. There has been controversy, however, amongst policy makers about the use of Avastin which is not specifically licensed for wet AMD.

""We found that sight was equally well preserved with either of the two drugs. Giving the treatment regularly every month resulted in slightly better levels of vision""

Professor Simon Harding, from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease and the St Paul's Eye Unit at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, said: ""Avastin is already used to treat wet AMD in some parts of the UK and extensively elsewhere in the world and also for other eye conditions.

""In our study, which included 610 people with AMD, patients received injections of the drug into the affected eye every month for the first three months. They were then subdivided to receive the injections each month.

""We found that sight was equally well preserved with either of the two drugs. Giving the treatment regularly every month resulted in slightly better levels of vision.""

Liverpool was the largest recruiting site for the study and also the supplier of the Avastin doses for the research.

Significant savings

The study, called IVAN, monitored the drugs for serious adverse drug reactions, including death, heart attacks and strokes. These were similar for the two drugs, reducing the previous concern that Avastin

may have a higher rate of stroke or heart attack.

Professor Harding added: ""We recommend that the NHS switch from Lucentis to Avastin and make significant savings to be reinvested in patient care.

""Surprisingly our safety findings show that the risk of death for people having continuous treatment is halved and this needs to be discussed with patients.""

The IVAN study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust sponsored the clinical trial.

For some people with epilepsy, inducing seizures is just as effective for determining their origin in the brain as those that happen spontaneously, a new study reports.

Surgery is the only way to stop seizures in 30 percent of patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy. People awaiting surgery often stay in hospital for one to two weeks to record medical observations of seizures.

Recording the source of the seizure lets doctors know what part of the brain to operate on. But these long stays can be extremely inconvenient for patients and expensive for health care systems.

In approximately 20 percent of patients, doctors have to insert electrodes directly into the brain. Patients with inserted electrodes often undergo cortical stimulation, a procedure that applies electrical current to the brain to map brain function but also to induce seizures for better understanding of the epileptic network.

No study until now has systematically addressed whether relying on induced seizures for surgery planning works as well as relying on spontaneous seizures.

For the new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers looked at data from 103 epilepsy patients in Montreal, Canada and Grenoble, France. The researchers used statistical methods to reveal correlations between the presence of stimulated seizures and their onset zone and patient outcome.

Patients who had induced seizures had better outcomes than patients who had no induced seizures. The researchers also found a strong similarity between the seizure onset zones which induced and spontaneous seizures identified.

This finding suggests that inducing seizures is as effective for determining the origin of seizures in the brain as spontaneous seizures, the researchers say. Using induced seizures in this way could mean much shorter hospital stays for patients awaiting surgery, and cost savings for hospitals that perform these operations.

""I think it would be a huge advantage if this procedure was done in the first days of a patient's stay,"" says lead researcher Birgit Frauscher of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital.

""It's not a new procedure, but the approach is new in the sense that now we know it's very similar to a spontaneous seizure, so we can reduce hospital time. Instead of being in hospital for two weeks, patients can may be there for 48 or 72 hours and we only need to record maybe one additional spontaneous seizures and not several, and that is a huge difference.""

The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Savoy Epilepsy Foundation, and Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec supported the work.

Additional coauthors are from McGill and the Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital in France.

Recording the source of the seizure lets doctors know what part of the brain to operate on. But these long stays can be extremely inconvenient for patients and expensive for health care systems.

In approximately 20 percent of patients, doctors have to insert electrodes directly into the brain. Patients with inserted electrodes often undergo cortical stimulation, a procedure that applies electrical current to the brain to map brain function but also to induce seizures for better understanding of the epileptic network.

No study until now has systematically addressed whether relying on induced seizures for surgery planning works as well as relying on spontaneous seizures.

For the new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers looked at data from 103 epilepsy patients in Montreal, Canada and Grenoble, France. The researchers used statistical methods to reveal correlations between the presence of stimulated seizures and their onset zone and patient outcome.

Patients who had induced seizures had better outcomes than patients who had no induced seizures. The researchers also found a strong similarity between the seizure onset zones which induced and spontaneous seizures identified.

This finding suggests that inducing seizures is as effective for determining the origin of seizures in the brain as spontaneous seizures, the researchers say. Using induced seizures in this way could mean much shorter hospital stays for patients awaiting surgery, and cost savings for hospitals that perform these operations.

""I think it would be a huge advantage if this procedure was done in the first days of a patient's stay,"" says lead researcher Birgit Frauscher of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital.

""It's not a new procedure, but the approach is new in the sense that now we know it's very similar to a spontaneous seizure, so we can reduce hospital time. Instead of being in hospital for two weeks, patients can may be there for 48 or 72 hours and we only need to record maybe one additional spontaneous seizures and not several, and that is a huge difference.""

The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Savoy Epilepsy Foundation, and Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec supported the work.

Ever wanted to act like an aging rock star and wear your sunglasses wherever you go, but feared that you didn't have a good enough reason to do so? The folks at Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology are here to help! What they've developed are a pair of so-called ""solar glasses,"" which generate electricity by way of solar cells that also double as the glasses' lenses. This electricity can be used to power smaller devices like pedometers or hearing aids -- or could possibly even give your smartphone or smartwatch some added juice as and when required.

""The solar glasses demonstrate integration of organic solar cells in smart devices,"" researcher Daniel Bahro, a PhD student specializing in the development and optimization of organic tandem-solar cells, told Digital Trends. ""This emerging photovoltaic technology offer some unique properties like transparency, tunability in color and shape, and its low weight makes it perfectly adaptable to any application design. The energy yield is used to drive an electronic circuit including sensors, a microprocessor and two displays attached to the temples. This very basic configuration of a smart device -- even under indoor lighting conditions -- continuously records the ambient temperature and the current output of the solar cells, without any additional power source like a battery.""

Understandably, the glasses work best in full sunlight, but each lens can still generate 200 microwatts even under 500 lux direct indoor illumination. No, that's not going to power your MacBook any time soon, but it could -- as Bahro notes -- be enough to charge smaller devices like step counters. Plus, with solar cells making advances all the time, this could just serve as a proof of concept to be further developed.

""Since we are a university-based research group, we are personally more focused on issues like advancing fabrication techniques and device architecture of the solar cells itself,"" Bahro said, concerning possible commercialization. ""The solar glasses were made to demonstrate what possible future applications and markets are in range, and should not be seen as a product ready for the market.""

If you are in the market for a portable solar cell, there are options like this new solar charging backpack which can provide a similar application -- albeit with larger solar cells. Still, now we've heard about this project, our hearts are kind of set on solar-charging shades.

Thus, they are suitable for a variety of applications that cannot be realized with conventional silicon solar cells. In the Energy Technology journal, researchers from KIT now present sunglasses with colored, semitransparent solar cells applied onto lenses that supply a microprocessor and two displays with electric power. This paves the way for other future applications such as the integration of organic solar cells into windows or overhead glazing.

""We bring solar power to places where other solar technologies fail,"" says Dr. Alexander Colsmann, Head of Organic Photovoltaics Group at KIT's Light Technology Institute (LTI). The ""smart"" Solar Glasses designed as a case study by the scientist and his team at KIT, is self-powered to measure and display the solar illumination intensity and ambient temperature. The solar cell lenses, perfectly fitted to a commercial frame, have a thickness of approx. 1.6 millimeters and weigh about six grams -- just like the lenses of traditional sunglasses. The microprocessor and the two small displays are integrated into the temples of the Solar Glasses. They show the illumination intensity and the ambient temperature as bar graphs. The Solar Glasses also work in indoor environments under illumination down to 500 Lux, which is the usual illumination of an office or a living area. Under these conditions, each of the ""smart"" lenses still generates 200 milliwatt of electric power -- enough to operate devices such as a hearing aid or a step counter.

""The Solar Glasses we developed are an example of how organic solar cells may be employed in applications that would not be feasible with conventional photovoltaics,"" stresses PhD student Dominik Landerer who largely contributed to the development of the solar glasses at the Material Research Center for Energy Systems of KIT. In the eyes of the engineer, these solar cells, which are based on hydrocarbons, are very exciting devices due to their mechanical flexibility and the opportunity to adapt their color, transparency, shape, and size to the desired application.

According to Colsmann, another field of application is the integration of solar cells into buildings: Since the glass facades of high-rise buildings must often be shaded, it is an obvious option to use organic solar modules for transforming the absorbed light into electric power. A future vision for the engineer, who works on the basic understanding of organic solar cell and semiconductor components at the Material Research Center for Energy Systems, is to coat large surfaces with organic solar cells using reel-to-reel technology. The KIT researchers present their study on solar sunglasses, entitled ""Solar Glasses: A Case Study on Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells for Self-Powered, Smart Wearable Devices,"" in the Energy Technology journal.

Thus, they are suitable for a variety of applications that cannot be realized with conventional silicon solar cells. In the Energy Technology journal, researchers from KIT now present sunglasses with colored, semitransparent solar cells applied onto lenses that supply a microprocessor and two displays with electric power. This paves the way for other future applications such as the integration of organic solar cells into windows or overhead glazing.<br><br>""We bring solar power to places where other solar technologies fail,"" says Dr. Alexander Colsmann, Head of Organic Photovoltaics Group at KIT's Light Technology Institute (LTI). The ""smart"" Solar Glasses designed as a case study by the scientist and his team at KIT, is self-powered to measure and display the solar illumination intensity and ambient temperature. The solar cell lenses, perfectly fitted to a commercial frame, have a thickness of approx. 1.6 millimeters and weigh about six grams -- just like the lenses of traditional sunglasses. The microprocessor and the two small displays are integrated into the temples of the Solar Glasses. They show the illumination intensity and the ambient temperature as bar graphs. The Solar Glasses also work in indoor environments under illumination down to 500 Lux, which is the usual illumination of an office or a living area. Under these conditions, each of the ""smart"" lenses still generates 200 milliwatt of electric power -- enough to operate devices such as a hearing aid or a step counter.<br><br>""The Solar Glasses we developed are an example of how organic solar cells may be employed in applications that would not be feasible with conventional photovoltaics,"" stresses PhD student Dominik Landerer who largely contributed to the development of the solar glasses at the Material Research Center for Energy Systems of KIT. In the eyes of the engineer, these solar cells, which are based on hydrocarbons, are very exciting devices due to their mechanical flexibility and the opportunity to adapt their color, transparency, shape, and size to the desired application.<br><br>According to Colsmann, another field of application is the integration of solar cells into buildings: Since the glass facades of high-rise buildings must often be shaded, it is an obvious option to use organic solar modules for transforming the absorbed light into electric power.

The findings are published in Clinical Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

""Memories of the love we felt in childhood towards our parents are among the most precious aspects of autobiographical memory we could think of,"" says lead author Lawrence Patihis, researcher at the University of Southern Mississippi. ""Yet our findings suggest that these memories of love are malleable -- which is not something we would want to be true.""

""If you change your evaluation of someone, you will likely also change your memory of your emotions towards them and this is true of memory of love towards mothers in childhood,"" Patihis explains.

For their first experiment, Patihis and coauthors Cristobal S. Cruz and Mario E. Herrera recruited 301 online participants. Some participants wrote about recent examples of their mother's positive attributes, such as showing warmth, generosity, competence, and giving good guidance; others wrote about recent examples of their mother's lack of these attributes. Participants in one comparison group wrote about a teacher and participants in another comparison group received no writing prompt at all.

The participants completed a survey assessing how they currently thought about their mother's attributes, including her warmth and generosity. They then completed the Memory of Love Towards Parents Questionnaire (MLPQ), which contained 10 items designed to measure the love participants remembered feeling for their mother at different ages (e.g., ""During the whole year when you were in first grade, how often on average did you feel love toward your mother?"" and ""During the whole year when you were in first grade, how strong on average was your love toward your mother?""). The MLPQ also measured participants' current feelings of love for their mothers.

The participants completed the measures again 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the initial session.

The results showed that the writing prompts influenced participants' current feelings and their memories of love. Specifically, participants who were prompted to write about their mother's positive attributes tended to recall stronger feelings of love for their mother in first, sixth, and ninth grade compared with participants who wrote about their mother's lack of positive attributes.

These effects endured at the 4-week follow-up for first grade memories, but not for memories of sixth grade or ninth grade.

Additional findings showed the effects of the writing prompts were not simply the result of changes in participants' mood.

A second experiment, with another 302 online participants, replicated these findings. Importantly, the participants did not differ in their current assessments of their mother before receiving the writing prompt, indicating that the effects of the writing prompts were not due to preexisting differences among participants. The findings also revealed that participants' current feelings of love for their mothers, as measured at the start of the experiment, were misremembered 8 weeks later following the experimental manipulation. The writing prompt effects had begun to fade by the time the researchers conducted an 8-week follow-up after the experiment.

The authors plan to expand this research to explore whether the same effects emerge for other emotions and target individuals and they're also exploring whether successes in life might similarly alter childhood memories of emotion. In addition, the researchers hope to find out whether these effects might influence later behavior.

""The significance of this research lies in the new knowledge that our current evaluations of people can be lowered if we choose to focus on the negative, and this can have a side effect: the diminishing of positive aspects of childhood memories,"" says Patihis. ""We wonder if wide-ranging reappraisals of parents -- perhaps in life or in therapy -- could lead to intergenerational heartache and estrangement. Understanding this subtle type of memory distortion is necessary if we want to prevent it.""",10,1.25,1,0.125,How our current thinking can sway our memories of love,"As our memories fade, we rely on our current assessment of a person to remember how we felt about them in the past, and new research suggests this extends to some of the most central figures in our lives: our parents.

This extends to some of the most central figures in our lives -- our parents.

""Memories of the love we felt in childhood towards our parents are among the most precious aspects of autobiographical memory we could think of,"" said lead author Dr. Lawrence Patihis, researcher at the University of Southern Mississippi. ""Yet our findings suggest that these memories of love are malleable, which is not something we would want to be true.""

""If you change your evaluation of someone, you will likely also change your memory of your emotions towards them and this is true of memory of love towards mothers in childhood,"" he continued.

For the study's first experiment, Patihis and coauthors Cristobal S. Cruz and Mario E. Herrera recruited 301 online participants. Some wrote about recent examples of their mother's positive attributes, such as showing warmth, generosity, competence and giving good guidance. Others wrote about recent examples of their mother's lack of these attributes. Participants in one comparison group wrote about a teacher and participants in another comparison group received no writing prompt at all.

The participants then completed a survey assessing how they currently thought about their mother's attributes, including her warmth and generosity.

They then completed the Memory of Love Towards Parents Questionnaire (MLPQ), which contained 10 items designed to measure the love participants remembered feeling for their mother at different ages, the researchers reported. Questions included ""During the whole year when you were in first grade, how often on average did you feel love toward your mother?"" and ""During the whole year when you were in first grade, how strong on average was your love toward your mother?""

The MLPQ also measured participants' current feelings of love for their mothers, according to the researchers.

The participants completed the questionnaires again two weeks and four weeks after the initial session.

The results showed that the writing prompts influenced participants' current feelings and their memories of love. Specifically, participants who were prompted to write about their mother's positive attributes tended to recall stronger feelings of love for their mother in first, sixth, and ninth grade compared with participants who wrote about their mother's lack of positive attributes.

These effects endured at the four-week follow-up for first grade memories, but not for memories of sixth grade or ninth grade, the study discovered.

Additional findings showed the effects of the writing prompts were not simply the result of changes in participants' mood, according to the researchers.

A second experiment, with another 302 online participants, replicated these findings. Importantly, the participants did not differ in their current assessments of their mother before receiving the writing prompt, indicating that the effects of the writing prompts were not due to preexisting differences among participants, the researchers explained.

The findings also revealed that participants' current feelings of love for their mothers, as measured at the start of the experiment, were misremembered eight weeks later following the experimental manipulation. The writing prompt effects had begun to fade by the time the researchers conducted an eight-week follow-up after the experiment.

The researchers plan to expand this research to explore whether the same effects emerge for other emotions and target individuals. They're also exploring whether successes in life might similarly alter childhood memories of emotion. In addition, the researchers hope to discover whether these effects might influence later behavior.

""The significance of this research lies in the new knowledge that our current evaluations of people can be lowered if we choose to focus on the negative, and this can have a side effect: The diminishing of positive aspects of childhood memories,"" Patihis said. ""We wonder if wide-ranging reappraisals of parents, perhaps in life or in therapy, could lead to intergenerational heartache and estrangement. Understanding this subtle type of memory distortion is necessary if we want to prevent it.""

The study was published in Clinical Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

May 15 (UPI) -- A mass of warm, saline water, called circumpolar deep water, or CDW, found in the Southern Ocean's Amundsen Sea, has been blamed for the destabilization of Antarctica's ice shelves.

Unfortunately, scientists have been limited in their ability to study and model the mass of water. That's changing thanks to two species of seal found in Western Antarctica.

In the summer, research vessels can access the Amundsen Sea, but thick sea ice and icebergs prevent scientists from collecting data during the winter. To improve their datasets, scientists at the University of East Anglia and the University of St. Andrews recruited dozens of seals to carry devices capable of recording temperature and salinity data.

Over a period of nine months, the seals recorded water data during 10,000 dives across a region of the Southern Ocean measuring 93,000 square miles.

The new data, transmitted via satellites when the seals surfaced from their dives, suggests the Amundsen Sea's CDW is thicker, warmer and saltier during the winter.

""We knew very little about what to expect from this research, since this is the first time that data has been collected in this way in this area,"" UEA researcher Helen Mallett said in a news release. ""We were able to collect much more information from the seals than all the previous ship-based surveys in the area combined and it was clear that, at least during the seasons we observed, there were substantial differences in temperature between the seasons.""

The new findings, detailed in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests the melting and disintegration of the ice shelf along Western Antarctica could be accelerated during the winter. Researchers say they need to continue collecting data over a series of winters to confirm the worrisome trend.

""Although more will need to be done to measure these differences over a number of years, it's clear that enlisting seals to collect this kind of ocean data will offer useful insights for climate change modelers who are attempting to predict how fast sea levels will rise,"" Mallet said.

The newly published data could also help marine biologists better understand the foraging patterns of Antarctic seals and how they might be impacted by climate change.

May 15 (UPI) -- A mass of warm, saline water, called circumpolar deep water, or CDW, found in the Southern Ocean's Amundsen Sea, has been blamed for the destabilization of Antarctica's ice shelves.

Unfortunately, scientists have been limited in their ability to study and model the mass of water. That's changing thanks to two species of seal found in Western Antarctica.

In the summer, research vessels can access the Amundsen Sea, but thick sea ice and icebergs prevent scientists from collecting data during the winter.

Environmental scientists ",0.9,1,"Two species of seal found in Antarctic seas are helping scientists collect data about the temperature and salinity of waters around vulnerable ice sheets in West Antarctica.

Environmental scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have been investigating ways of studying warm, salty, deep water in the Amundsen Sea, in the Southern Ocean. Understanding more about how this water gets towards the ice shelves by measuring its temperature, salinity and depth, will help climate change modellers make more accurate predictions about how rapidly the Antarctic ice sheet is melting.

As the ice in west Antarctica melts, it has been estimated that sea levels could rise by up to 3.2 metres, with much of the water draining through two glaciers -- Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier -- in the Amundsen Sea. Estimates of future sea level rise vary a lot and scientists need year-round observations to assess and improve climate change models.

Gathering data in summer months is relatively straightforward but getting ships near the area during the winter is impossible because the area is covered in a thick blanket of sea ice. The only information available is from 'moorings', strings of measurement devices anchored to the sea floor. These can collect data from a few fixed locations, but they cannot measure near the sea surface at all because the huge icebergs would collide with them.

To address this, the UEA team set up a collaboration with the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews who were interested in recording the feeding behaviours of seals in the region. The expedition built on an idea originally suggested by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey when they became aware of a large elephant seal haulout on islands near the Pine island Glacier.

Funded by the Natural Environment Research Council's Ice Sheet Stability Research Programme (iSTAR), the experiment began in February 2014, when the team tagged seven southern elephant seals and seven Weddell seals with devices that can send information via satellite. Measurements of the warmth and saltiness of the water were sent by the seals as they moved around the area and dived from the surface of the ocean down through the water to the sea bed in their hunt for food.

Over a period of nine months, throughout the Antarctic winter, the team collected data from more than 10,000 dives over an area of around 150,000 square km. The seals continued to send back signals until they moulted and the devices dropped off.

Analysing the findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers discovered that not only is the layer of CDW thicker in winter, it is also warmer and saltier than during summer months. This suggests that there is likely to be more melting of the ice sheets during the winter months. The temperature differences were less marked closer to one of the glaciers, in a region called Pine Island Bay, possibly because ocean currents, called gyres, recirculate the water.

""We knew very little about what to expect from this research, since this is the first time that data has been collected in this way in this area,"" says Helen Mallett, who led the study at UEA. ""We were able to collect much more information from the seals than all the previous ship-based surveys in the area combined and it was clear that, at least during the seasons we observed, there were substantial differences in temperature between the seasons.

""Although more will need to be done to measure these differences over a number of years, it's clear that enlisting seals to collect this kind of ocean data will offer useful insights for climate change modellers who are attempting to predict how fast sea levels will rise.""

The data will be useful to marine biologists as well, as it will provide new understanding of the foraging behaviour of seals in the Amundsen Sea, and how that might be affected by climate change, as well as commercial fisheries.

A team of scientists recently published the first in-depth paper (paywall) on a deepwater current surrounding west Antarctica, known as the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). And to help them with the actual research, they recruited a few locals: seven southern elephant seals and seven Weddell seals.

And those are immobile; the seals managed to cover 150,000 sq km (57,915 sq mi) of the icy continent's coast.

From the seal-collected data, the research team learned that every winter, the CDW moves clockwise around the continent, bringing deeper, salty water to the coasts of some of the underbellies of the continent's floating sea ice connected to glaciers. This salty water is an average of 0.32degC (about 0.6degF) warmer than colder waters closer to the surface of the ice, and threaten to melt more of the glaciers an area already melting quickly thanks to climate change. Scientists hope that by better understanding the CDW's circulation patterns, they can improve models for Antarctic ice melting rates and subsequent sea-level rise.

He had a very small practice on a very small main street. He'd get calls in the middle of the night, and his patients never doubted he would show up at their home, doctor's bag in hand. They trusted that my dad would take care of them no matter what, regardless of their ability to pay. Before I ever recognized it for what it was, trust was the essential driver of this doctor-patient relationship -- it was the currency of healthcare delivery in my hometown.

Trust is the ultimate currency

At the World Economic Forum held earlier this year, the importance of trust in business and the erosion of the public's trust in companies and government were major themes. A large sign at the entry to the conference read: ""Trust is the ultimate currency.""

Defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something,"" trust has been the currency of our world since the early days of bartering. There would be no economy or commerce or any kind of exchange without a certain level of trust.

Any relationship -- professional or personal -- is based on trust. Whether it be a relationship between people selling and buying a product or between patients in need of care and doctors providing that care, trust is at the core of every exchange.

Working in the technology industry, I learned that earning the trust of users is imperative to gaining their adoption of an application. To quote Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO of Salesforce, ""trust has to be the highest value in your company."" The key to business sustainability comes down one thing: build trust by acting in the customer's best interest.

The cost of trust erosion

In today's environment of political polarization, ""fake news"", competing and contradictory sources of information, conflicts of interest, and lack of disclosure, it's no surprise that people are losing trust in government, business leaders, technology and the news they read.

Since the days of my dad making house calls to care for his patients, trust in healthcare has fallen precipitously. According to Gallup polls, in 2017, only 36 percent of the public said they had a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in U.S. medical system -- down from 80 percent in 1975.

So, what happens when there is an erosion of trust? Many of us can share a personal story of a relationship broken or weakened by a breach of trust. Lack of trust creates an environment where people do not feel safe.

Within industries, a breakdown of trust can hinder progress, innovation, and growth. For patients, it can reduce treatment compliance, leading to negative impacts on health. A recent study found that breast cancer patients with the most distrust of the healthcare system were 22 percent more likely to report not getting at least one post-surgical treatment than patients with the least distrust. Other research has found that lack of trust among healthcare staff can reduce the quality of care provided.

Why trust matters in healthcare

There are many players in the healthcare space -- physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, health IT companies, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and government agencies, to name a few. Each has the potential to build trust-based relationships with patients.

In today's world, it's hard for patients to trust that the healthcare system will take care of them. With trust, patients feel less vulnerable and providers can be more effective. Research shows that patients who have more trust in their healthcare professionals have less symptoms, are more satisfied with their treatment, report a higher quality of life and pursue healthier behaviors.

Treating trust as a core operating principle in the healthcare industry is powerful. It plays into every decision that people make about their care. It fosters better outcomes as well as innovation.

Building a foundation of trust in healthcare

Trust must be earned with every action. Several practices are key to cultivating trust:

Transparency -- Patients expect transparency. Healthcare organizations and companies have a responsibility to provide it. With transparency, all stakeholders know what's expected, what they're going to get, and what they're accountable for.

He had a very small practice on a very small main street. He'd get calls in the middle of the night, and his patients never doubted he would show up at their home, doctor's bag in hand. They trusted that my dad would take care of them no matter what, regardless of their ability to pay. Before I ever recognized it for what it was, trust was the essential driver of this doctor-patient relationship -- it was the currency of healthcare delivery in my hometown.

Trust is the ultimate currency

At the World Economic Forum held earlier this year, the importance of trust in business and the erosion of the public's trust in companies and government were major themes. A large sign at the entry to the conference read: ""Trust is the ultimate currency.""

Defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something,"" trust has been the currency of our world since the early days of bartering. There would be no economy or commerce or any kind of exchange without a certain level of trust.

Any relationship -- professional or personal -- is based on trust. Whether it be a relationship between people selling and buying a product or between patients in need of care and doctors providing that care, trust is at the core of every exchange.

Working in the technology industry, I learned that earning the trust of users is imperative to gaining their adoption of an application. To quote Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO of Salesforce, ""trust has to be the highest value in your company."" The key to business sustainability comes down one thing: build trust by acting in the customer's best interest.

The cost of trust erosion

In today's environment of political polarization, ""fake news"", competing and contradictory sources of information, conflicts of interest, and lack of disclosure, it's no surprise that people are losing trust in government, business leaders, technology and the news they read.

Since the days of my dad making house calls to care for his patients, trust in healthcare has fallen precipitously. According to Gallup polls, in 2017, only 36 percent of the public said they had a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in U.S. medical system -- down from 80 percent in 1975.

So, what happens when there is an erosion of trust? Many of us can share a personal story of a relationship broken or weakened by a breach of trust. Lack of trust creates an environment where people do not feel safe.

Within industries, a breakdown of trust can hinder progress, innovation, and growth. For patients, it can reduce treatment compliance, leading to negative impacts on health. A recent study found that breast cancer patients with the most distrust of the healthcare system were 22 percent more likely to report not getting at least one post-surgical treatment than patients with the least distrust. Other research has found that lack of trust among healthcare staff can reduce the quality of care provided.

Why trust matters in healthcare

There are many players in the healthcare space -- physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, health IT companies, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and government agencies, to name a few. Each has the potential to build trust-based relationships with patients.

In today's world, it's hard for patients to trust that the healthcare system will take care of them. With trust, patients feel less vulnerable and providers can be more effective. Research shows that patients who have more trust in their healthcare professionals have less symptoms, are more satisfied with their treatment, report a higher quality of life and pursue healthier behaviors.

Treating trust as a core operating principle in the healthcare industry is powerful. It plays into every decision that people make about their care. It fosters better outcomes as well as innovation.

Building a foundation of trust in healthcare

Trust must be earned with every action. Several practices are key to cultivating trust:

Nearly a third of women with breast cancer reject their doctors' advice and either skip or fail to finish treatment to kill leftover tumor cells after surgery.

A new survey of 2,754 breast cancer patients in Florida and Pennsylvania shows that ""treatment discordance""--not following a recommended treatment plan in its entirety--is more likely among patients who report a general distrust of medical institutions and insurers. Patients' trust in their own doctors does not seem to be a factor.

""If we want more women with breast cancer to complete their treatment, we'll need to deal with their beliefs about the health-care system--and I do think we can modify those beliefs,"" says Lorraine T. Dean, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead author of the study in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

Small studies previously found that some patients refuse their doctors' advice and choose not to undergo or complete adjuvant therapy after breast cancer surgery. The new study, by far the largest on the issue, suggests that the avoidance of adjuvant therapy is significant and linked to a general distrust in the health-care system.

Adjuvant therapy

Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer normally consists of a course of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or radiation treatment, and is meant to kill any cancer cells not removed by surgery. Research shows that adjuvant therapy on average reduces the likelihood of breast-cancer recurrence and increases patients' chances of long-term survival.

Yet it has long been clear that many patients either do not start follow-up therapy or start but do not complete it. Cancer epidemiologists would like to know why, hoping to improve treatment compliance and improve long-term outcomes.

Prior studies, which were smaller in sample size and geographic scope, linked breast cancer treatment discordance to patients' lack of trust in the general health-care system, but were not clear about whether that is distinct from distrust of physicians.

How to build trust?

For the new study, researchers sought to clarify the issue with a large survey of breast cancer patients in two major US states and mailed survey questions to women in Pennsylvania and Florida cancer registries who were diagnosed with invasive but still localized breast cancer between 2005 and 2007. All were under age 65 when diagnosed.

The response rate was 61 percent and the final sample included 2,754 women. About 69.8 percent said they received all adjuvant treatments their doctor had recommended. The remainder, 30.2 percent, indicated that they had elected not to receive at least one prescribed treatment.

More than half of the latter, or 18 percent of the cohort, had not undergone some or all of recommended hormone therapy; the rest were evenly split between missing some or all radiation treatment and some or all chemotherapy.

""While it is surprising in general that nearly one-third of patients are not following up with recommended adjuvant treatment, some earlier, more localized studies have reported even higher discordance rates,"" Dean says, ""and it's possible that our own figures would have been higher if we had followed patients for more than two years.""

The survey asked participants about trust in their doctors and the health-care system in general. Researchers used the patients' responses to place them into high and low categories of general health-care system distrust, and found that those in the ""high distrust"" category were about 22 percent more likely to report not having received all recommended treatments.

The results confirm the link seen in prior, smaller studies between breast-cancer treatment discordance and general distrust in the health-care system. The findings also suggest that this general distrust of medical institutions and the associated treatment discordance aren't significantly influenced by a patient's attitude towards her own doctor. Many patients trusted their doctors even when they did not trust the broader health-care system.

""Improving health-care system distrust may require strategies that are not solely focused on boosting physician trust,"" Dean says.

A decision to avoid or stop adjuvant therapy would be rational in cases where treatment is unnecessary, she says. However, patients reporting treatment discordance were 40 percent more likely to have a cancer recurrence during the study period--underscoring the importance of improving treatment compliance and, to that end, trust in the health-care system.

""If ordinary businesses can learn to increase trust in their brands, why not the same with health-care institutions?"" Dean says.

Cancer epidemiologists would like to know why, hoping to improve treatment compliance and improve long-term outcomes.<br><br>Prior studies, which were smaller in sample size and geographic scope, linked breast cancer treatment discordance to patients' lack of trust in the general health-care system, but were not clear about whether that is distinct from distrust of physicians.<br><br>How to build trust?<br><br>For the new study, researchers sought to clarify the issue with a large survey of breast cancer patients in two major US states and mailed survey questions to women in Pennsylvania and Florida cancer registries who were diagnosed with invasive but still localized breast cancer between 2005 and 2007. All were under age 65 when diagnosed.<br><br>The response rate was 61 percent and the final sample included 2,754 women. About 69.8 percent said they received all adjuvant treatments their doctor had recommended. The remainder, 30.2 percent, indicated that they had elected not to receive at least one prescribed treatment.<br><br>More than half of the latter, or 18 percent of the cohort, had not undergone some or all of recommended hormone therapy; the rest were evenly split between missing some or all radiation treatment and some or all chemotherapy.<br><br>""While it is surprising in general that nearly one-third of patients are not following up with recommended adjuvant treatment, some earlier, more localized studies have reported even higher discordance rates,"" Dean says, ""and it's possible that our own figures would have been higher if we had followed patients for more than two years.""<br><br>The survey asked participants about trust in their doctors and the health-care system in general. Researchers used the patients' responses to place them into high and low categories of general health-care system distrust, and found that those in the ""high distrust"" category were about 22 percent more likely to report not having received all recommended treatments.<br><br>The results confirm the link seen in prior, smaller studies between breast-cancer treatment discordance and general distrust in the health-care system. The findings also suggest that this general distrust of medical institutions and the associated treatment discordance aren't significantly influenced by a patient's attitude towards her own doctor. Many patients trusted their doctors even when they did not trust the broader health-care system.<br><br>""Improving health-care system distrust may require strategies that are not solely focused on boosting physician trust,"" Dean says.<br><br>A decision to avoid or stop adjuvant therapy would be rational in cases where treatment is unnecessary, she says. However, patients reporting treatment discordance were 40 percent more likely to have a cancer recurrence during the study period--underscoring the importance of improving treatment compliance and, to that end, trust in the health-care system.<br><br>""If ordinary businesses can learn to increase trust in their brands, why not the same with health-care institutions?"" Dean says.<br><br>Johns Hopkins and the National Institutes of Health supported the work.<br><br>Source: Johns Hopkins University </div>"

WEDNESDAY, March 27, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than a quarter of people who could benefit from taking statins don't, and a new survey suggests ",0.5714285714285714,1,"By Dennis Thompson

WEDNESDAY, March 27, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than a quarter of people who could benefit from taking statins don't, and a new survey suggests that while not enough doctors are prescribing the cholesterol-lowering drugs, fears about side effects also play a part.

""There is so much misinformation about statins in the media that it's clearly permeated and now is affecting people's ability to take these medications and improve their cardiovascular health,"" said lead author Dr. Corey Bradley. She's a researcher at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C.

The new survey focused on almost 5,700 older adults who'd been recommended for statin therapy, based on data kept in a national registry that tracks cholesterol management and heart disease treatment.

Popular prescribed statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), pravastatin (Pravachol) and simvastatin (Zocor).

More than 26 percent of the patients, 1,511, were not taking statins even though they'd benefit from them, the survey revealed.

About 31 percent of those not taking statins said they'd tried the drugs but stopped, and another 10 percent said they turned down the medication outright when a doctor recommended it, researchers found.

Side effects were the most common reason given by these folks, and they were less likely to believe statins are safe than people who used the medication.

However, there's also strong evidence that doctors aren't doing everything they can to prescribe these medications for those who need them.

Fifty-nine percent of adults not taking statins said they weren't because a doctor had never offered them a prescription.

It's possible that some of these people were offered statins and forgot, but that in itself is damning, Bradley said.

""If a patient didn't remember the conversation, it likely wasn't an effective one,"" she said. ""We need to improve the way we frame these conversations and continue to have them.""

The findings were published March 27 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Bad or misleading information circulating about statins is overwhelming doctors' efforts to get patients to take the cholesterol-fighting medications, said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, who wasn't involved with the study. She's a cardiologist and medical director of the NYU Langone Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health in New York City.

Estimates are that about 1 in every 10 patients have a side effect from statins, Goldberg said. Muscle aches are the most commonly reported side effect.

Despite this, clinical trials have shown that the difference in muscle ache symptoms between people on statins and those taking placebos is less than 1 percent, and about 0.1 percent for people who stopped taking statins due to muscle pain, according to a December review published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.

""When patients get a new medicine, they discuss it with their friends or they look it up online, and they get so much information,"" Goldberg said. ""Some of patients who really are concerned about taking the medicine are really only focused on the side effects. They go online and get the side effects of the medicine, and that data is not put into perspective for them by anyone.""

Patients were more likely to report never being offered a statin if they were female (22 percent higher odds), black (48 percent higher), or uninsured (38 percent higher). Those seen by a cardiologist were more likely to be offered a statin than those in primary care.

Bradley and Goldberg said doctors need to come up with better ways to talk with patients about statins and the drugs' perceived side effects, especially if the person has stopped taking them.

Despite their concerns, about 60 percent of the patients who stopped taking a statin would consider retrying it, the survey showed.

""We have a tendency to view that if a patient stops a medication they were previously on, then that's a closed door,"" Bradley said. ""This study suggests we should re-engage with the patient and discuss their concerns.""

Goldberg said she encourages her patients to forward their questions and concerns through a secure internet portal, ""so there's a continuing dialogue.

""We don't start the day wanting to prescribe medicine to everyone, but we do want to lower a person's risk, and sometimes lowering risk for heart disease involves not only diet and exercise, but needing a medication,"" Goldberg said.

The researchers found that 26.5 percent of the patients were not on treatment. Overall, 59.2 percent of those not on a statin reported never being offered a statin, while 10.1 and 30.7 percent declined a statin and discontinued therapy, respectively. The likelihood of reporting never being offered a statin was increased for women, black adults, and those without insurance (relative risks, 1.22, 1.48, and 1.38, respectively). The most common reasons cited for declining or discontinuing a statin were fear of side effects and perceived side effects.

WEDNESDAY, March 27, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than a quarter of people who could benefit from taking statins don't, and a new survey suggests that while not enough doctors are prescribing the cholesterol-lowering drugs, fears about side effects also play a part.""There is so much misinformation about statins in the media that it's clearly permeated and now is affecting people's ability to take these medications and improve their cardiovascular health,"" said lead author Dr. Corey Bradley. She's a researcher at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C.The new survey focused on almost 5,700 older adults who'd been recommended for statin therapy, based on data kept in a national registry that tracks cholesterol management and heart disease treatment.Popular prescribed statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), pravastatin (Pravachol) and simvastatin (Zocor). More than 26 percent of the patients, 1,511, were not taking statins even though they'd benefit from them, the survey revealed.About 31 percent of those not taking statins said they'd tried the drugs but stopped, and another 10 percent said they turned down the medication outright when a doctor recommended it, researchers found.Side effects were the most common reason given by these folks, and they were less likely to believe statins are safe than people who used the medication.However, there's also strong evidence that doctors aren't doing everything they can to prescribe these medications for those who need them.Fifty-nine percent of adults not taking statins said they weren't because a doctor had never offered them a prescription.It's possible that some of these people were offered statins and forgot, but that in itself is damning, Bradley said.""If a patient didn't remember the conversation, it likely wasn't an effective one,"" she said. ""We need to improve the way we frame these conversations and continue to have them.""The findings were published March 27 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.Bad or misleading information circulating about statins is overwhelming doctors' efforts to get patients to take the cholesterol-fighting medications, said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, who wasn't involved with the study. She's a cardiologist and medical director of the NYU Langone Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health in New York City.Estimates are that about 1 in every 10 patients have a side effect from statins, Goldberg said. Muscle aches are the most commonly reported side effect.Despite this, clinical trials have shown that the difference in muscle ache symptoms between people on statins and those taking placebos is less than 1 percent, and about 0.1 percent for people who stopped taking statins due to muscle pain, according to a December review published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.""When patients get a new medicine, they discuss it with their friends or they look it up online, and they get so much information,"" Goldberg said. ""Some of patients who really are concerned about taking the medicine are really only focused on the side effects. They go online and get the side effects of the medicine, and that data is not put into perspective for them by anyone.""Patients were more likely to report never being offered a statin if they were female (22 percent higher odds), black (48 percent higher), or uninsured (38 percent higher). Those seen by a cardiologist were more likely to be offered a statin than those in primary care.Bradley and Goldberg said doctors need to come up with better ways to talk with patients about statins and the drugs' perceived side effects, especially if the person has stopped taking them.Despite their concerns, about 60 percent of the patients who stopped taking a statin would consider retrying it, the survey showed.""We have a tendency to view that if a patient stops a medication they were previously on, then that's a closed door,"" Bradley said. ""This study suggests we should re-engage with the patient and discuss their concerns.""Goldberg said she encourages her patients to forward their questions and concerns through a secure internet portal, ""so there's a continuing dialogue.""We don't start the day wanting to prescribe medicine to everyone, but we do want to lower a person's risk, and sometimes lowering risk for heart disease involves not only diet and exercise, but needing a medication,"" Goldberg said.PaginationCan they help lower yours?What it can do for you.(c) 2005 - 2019 WebMD LLC.

Extracellular vesicles are currently of particular interest in the scientific community for their therapeutic potential as part of gene and cell-based therapies, but the trick has been producing them in large quantities. They are shed by cells and play an important role in intercellular communication. Exosomes are one type and they are small structures that can fuse with the cell membrane without any help.

In this study, lead author Dr Baisong Lu , and colleagues describe the method which addresses the challenges and removes barriers associated with the delivery via exosomes of the miRNAs which are small molecules that have a part in the regulation of gene expression. There are thousands of different types of miRNAs with different functions. For example, some have anti-tumor function while others promote regeneration of bone or muscle.

""By themselves, the miRNAs are unstable and unable to get into the cells themselves. Being able to deliver large quantities of miRNA-enriched exosomes makes it possible to explore therapeutic applications of specific miRNAs,"" said Dr Lu, an Assistant Professor of regenerative medicine at WFIRM.

In the study, the researchers show that overexpressing a miRNA precursor in cells enormously increases the specific miRNA content in extracellular vesicles. Growing cells in bioreactors can generate large quantities of miRNA-enriched extracellular vesicles that can be concentrated by tangential flow filtration, a rapid and efficient method for separation and purification of biomolecules. The extracellular vesicles thus produced can enter into cells in vitro and can increase circulating miRNA levels in vivo in animal models.

""Extracellular vesicles and exosomes, in particular, have been of interest as drug delivery vehicles but their use to deliver miRNAs has been hampered by difficulties associated with loading miRNAs into exosomes,"" said WFIRM Director Dr Anthony Atala , who is a co-author of the paper. ""Other methods are inefficient and incompatible with large-scale preparation so we set out to solve this problem.""

In a move that signals the impact of the research, the paper states that the large-scale production method created by WFIRM scientists ""could serve as an important template for advancing research and overcoming the lack of method standardisation in development of [extracellular vesicle] therapeutics, taking the entire field closer to clinical translation.""

""We are pleased that a journal of note like Science Translational Medicine has highlighted this latest research from our institute,"" said Dr Atala .

There are thousands of different types of miRNAs with different functions. For example, some have anti-tumor function while others promote regeneration of bone or muscle.



""By themselves, the miRNAs are unstable and unable to get into the cells themselves. Being able to deliver large quantities of miRNA-enriched exosomes makes it possible to explore therapeutic applications of specific miRNAs,"" said Lu, an assistant professor of regenerative medicine at WFIRM.



In the study, the researchers show that overexpressing a miRNA precursor in cells enormously increases the specific miRNA content in extracellular vesicles. Growing cells in bioreactors can generate large quantities of miRNA-enriched extracellular vesicles that can be concentrated by tangential flow filtration, a rapid and efficient method for separation and purification of biomolecules. The extracellular vesicles thus produced can enter into cells in vitro and can increase circulating miRNA levels in vivo in animal models.



""Extracellular vesicles and exosomes, in particular, have been of interest as drug delivery vehicles but their use to deliver miRNAs has been hampered by difficulties associated with loading miRNAs into exosomes,"" said WFIRM Director Anthony Atala, M.D., who is a co-author of the paper. ""Other methods are inefficient and incompatible with large-scale preparation so we set out to solve this problem.""



In a move that signals the impact of the research, Science Translational Medicine journal writes that the large-scale production method created by WFIRM scientists ""could serve as an important template for advancing research and overcoming the lack of method standardization in development of [extracellular vesicle] therapeutics, taking the entire field closer to clinical translation.""



""We are pleased that a journal of note like Science Translational Medicine has highlighted this latest research from our institute,"" said Atala. ""One of our goals to advance the field of regenerative medicine is to find ways to standardize the manufacturing process involved in creating our technologies. This research is a tremendous step forward.

BERLIN, July 14 (UPI) -- The question as to why many domestic species share similar features and behaviors has long troubled scientists. Even Darwin, the father of evolutionary biology, was puzzled.

""Because Darwin made his observations just as the science of genetics was beginning, the domestication syndrome is one of the oldest problems in the field,"" said Adam Wilkins, a researcher from the Humboldt University of Berlin and co-author of a new study on the subject.

Wilkins' new study, published this week in the journal Genetics, suggests traits like floppy ears and splotches of white hair or fur are byproducts of domestication.

As the new research explains it, the majority of the characteristics that can be traced from one domesticated species to another are traits largely controlled by what's known as the neural crest. The neural crest is a group cells containing instructions for how different parts of the body and different tissue types form and mature -- like the color of fur and skin or the structure of ear cartilage.

Located at the top of spinal cord, the cells migrate throughout the body to communicate these instructions, their coding dictating the tissue traits of pigment cells and parts of the skull, jaws, teeth, and ears. The neural crest also contains genetic instructions for the body's adrenal system which controls the ""fight-or-flight"" response.

""When humans bred these animals for tameness, they may have inadvertently selected those with mild neural crest deficits, resulting in smaller or slow-maturing adrenal glands,"" Wilkins explained. ""So, these animals were less fearful.""

In the the process of domestication and manipulation of the adrenal glands -- from generation to generation -- humans seem to have caused a series of common genetic mutations in domesticated species, byproducts of the quest for tamer animals.

""This interesting idea (the new theory) based in developmental biology brings us closer to solving a riddle that's been with us a long time. It provides a unifying hypothesis to test and brings valuable insight into the biology of domestication,"" said Mark Johnston, Genetics' editor-in-chief.

Compared to their wild ancestors, domestic species are more tame, and they also tend to display a suite of other characteristic features, including floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws. Since Darwin's observations, the explanation for this pattern has proved elusive, but now, in a Perspectives article published in the journal GENETICS, a new hypothesis has been proposed that could explain why breeding for tameness causes changes in such diverse traits.

The underlying link between these features could be the group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest, suggest the authors. Although this proposal has not yet been tested, it is the first unified hypothesis that connects several components of the ""domestication syndrome."" It not only applies to mammals like dogs, foxes, pigs, horses, sheep and rabbits, but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish.

""Because Darwin made his observations just as the science of genetics was beginning, the domestication syndrome is one of the oldest problems in the field. So it was tremendously exciting when we realized that the neural crest hypothesis neatly ties together this hodge-podge of traits,"" says Adam Wilkins, from the Humboldt University of Berlin. Wilkins is an editor at GENETICS and one of the paper's authors.

Neural crest cells are formed near the developing spinal cord of early vertebrate embryos. As the embryo matures, the cells migrate to different parts of the body and give rise to many tissue types. These tissues include pigment cells and parts of the skull, jaws, teeth, and ears--as well as the adrenal glands, which are the center of the ""fight-or-flight"" response. Neural crest cells also indirectly affect brain development.

In the hypothesis proposed by Wilkins and co-authors Richard Wrangham of Harvard University and Tecumseh Fitch of the University of Vienna, domesticated mammals may show impaired development or migration of neural crest cells compared to their wild ancestors.

""When humans bred these animals for tameness, they may have inadvertently selected those with mild neural crest deficits, resulting in smaller or slow-maturing adrenal glands,"" Wilkins says. ""So, these animals were less fearful.""

But the neural crest influences more than adrenal glands. Among other effects, neural crest deficits can cause depigmentation in some areas of skin (e.g. white patches), malformed ear cartilage, tooth anomalies, and jaw development changes, all of which are seen in the domestication syndrome. The authors also suggest that the reduced forebrain size of most domestic mammals could be an indirect effect of neural crest changes, because a chemical signal sent by these cells is critical for proper brain development.

""This interesting idea based in developmental biology brings us closer to solving a riddle that's been with us a long time. It provides a unifying hypothesis to test and brings valuable insight into the biology of domestication,"" says Mark Johnston, Editor-in-Chief of GENETICS.

Tests of the neural crest hypothesis may not be far off, as other scientists are rapidly mapping the genes that have been altered by domestication in the rat, fox, and dog. The hypothesis predicts that some of these genes will influence neural crest cell biology.

If so, we will have a much deeper understanding of the biology underlying a significant evolutionary event, Wilkins says. ""Animal domestication was a crucial step in the development of human civilizations. Without these animals, it's hard to imagine that human societies would have thrived in the way they have.""

Compared to their wild ancestors, domesticated animals are cuter and tamer, and researchers behind a new study propose that a type of embryonic stem cell is the reason why breeding for tameness causes changes in such diverse traits.

More than 140 years ago, famed scientist Charles Darwin was the first to notice that domesticated species are not only more tame, but also tend to display a suite of other characteristic features, including floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws.

The explanation for this pattern remains unknown, but this study is the first to come up with a unified hypothesis for ""domestication syndrome.""

The authors suggest that the underlying link between these features could be the group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest. Although the theory has yet to be tested, it could apply not only to mammals like dogs, foxes, pigs, horses, sheep and rabbits, but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish.

""Because Darwin made his observations just as the science of genetics was beginning, the domestication syndrome is one of the oldest problems in the field. So it was tremendously exciting when we realized that the neural crest hypothesis neatly ties together this hodge-podge of traits,"" Adam Wilkins, one of the researchers, said in a statement.

Neural crest cells are formed near the developing spinal cord of early vertebrate embryos. As the embryo matures, the cells migrate to different parts of the body and give rise to many tissue types, including parts of the skull, jaws, teeth and ears, as well as the adrenal glands.

However, domesticated mammals may show impaired development or migration of neural crest cells compared to their wild ancestors, according to the newly proposed theory.

""When humans bred these animals for tameness, they may have inadvertently selected those with mild neural crest deficits, resulting in smaller or slow-maturing adrenal glands,"" Wilkins explained. ""So, these animals were less fearful.""

Among other effects, neural crest deficits can cause depigmentation in some areas of skin (white patches), malformed ear cartilage, tooth anomalies and jaw development changes, all of which are seen in the domestication syndrome.

""This interesting idea based in developmental biology brings us closer to solving a riddle that's been with us a long time,"" added Mark Johnston, Editor-in-Chief of Genetics, the journal in which this study was published.",5,0.7142857142857143,0,0.0,Domestication Syndrome: Why Cute Looks Come with Breeding for Tameness,"Compared to their wild ancestors, domesticated animals are cuter and tamer, and researchers behind a new study propose that a type of embryonic stem cell is the reason why breeding for tameness causes changes in such diverse traits.
