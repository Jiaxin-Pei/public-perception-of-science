Not really, but they are one of the most contaminated avian species on the planet, according to researchers from the University of Michigan in a recent edition of the Journal of Great Lakes Research.

Nil Basu, an associate professor at McGill University who conducted his research while at the Ann Arbor-based university, and his colleagues analyzed hepatic polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) levels in Wisconsin river otters and Michigan bald eagles from 2009 to 2011.

According to PlanetExperts.com, the researchers examined 33 eagles, and found that all but two of them tested positive for at least four common types of PBDE, a type of flame retardant which were commonly used from 1970 through 2004, when they were banned and/or phased out.

In fact, one of the bald eagles tested measured at 1,538 parts per billion PBDEs in its liver, the website explained. In comparison, the median concentration in humans in the US is about 30 ppb, making it one of the highest concentration rates in the world.

Previous studies have linked exposure to the substance to liver, thyroid and brain damage in humans, and in birds, it has been associated with hormone disruption, reproductive issues and behavioral and developmental problems. While the population is stable, the eagles had PBDE concentrations that were ""among the highest...in liver tissues of any wildlife.""

""While the sensitivity of eagles to PBDEs has yet to be determined, there is a possibility that the exposures reported here may be associated with sub-clinical effects,"" Basu explained Monday in an interview with Scientific American. While the flame retardant is no longer used, it can still be found in air, dirt and residents all over the world, including in and around Michigan,

The chemicals ""are everywhere. They build up in the food chains so that top predators - such as bald eagles - accumulate high levels,"" Basu added. The compound seeps out of the products they were used in, he noted, and once it gets into the environment it can stay there a long time. Basu believes that the birds were exposed to the flame retardant by eating contaminated fish, but noted that they may also have inhaled it or licked tainted dust off of their feathers.

A history of PBDE

The four major PBDE compounds found in the bald eagles were components of a flame retardant that was sold commercially as penta-PBDE mixture, which was used in cars, wire insulation and plastics. In 2009, penta was added to the UN Stockholm Convention as a persistent pollutant that was to be phased out internationally. Yet, it has remain present in the environment.

PBDEs are ""very persistent"" once they get into the environment, explained Indiana University assistant scientist Marta Venier. ""We can expect to see PBDEs in wildlife for a long time."" The new study also found PBDEs in the liver tissue of 100 percent of 35 dead river otters collected throughout Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010, Scientific American added.

Exposure to the flame retardants have also been linked to lower nest temperatures, smaller eggs with thinner shells, delayed egg laying, a reduced number of mating calls and loss of appetite in birds, the website added. However, the chemicals affect different species in different ways, so it is possible that the PBDE compounds impact the bald eagles in different ways.

""If there were health problems, it would be kind of under the radar and we wouldn't necessarily notice in the [dead] birds we got in here,"" Tom Cooley, a wildlife pathologist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, told Scientific American.

Furthermore, the eagles could have more flame-retardants on them that the research indicates, since Basu and his colleagues only looked for four specific types. While the lead author said that the PBDE levels of the eagles should eventually decrease, that could take ""years or decades.""

An important new study has predicted that global demand for fossil fuels is going to plummet in the near future, causing a huge ""carbon bubble"" up to 16 times bigger than the one that caused the 2008 financial crisis.

The research reveals that the global transition away from fossil fuels is likely inevitable, regardless of whether major nations adopt climate polices that promote renewable energy.

The study flies in the face of world leaders like President Trump, who have promised to revive the struggling coal industry at the expense of renewable energy.

""Our analysis suggests that, contrary to investor expectations, the stranding of fossil fuels assets may happen even without new climate policies,"" said co-author Jorge Vinuales, the chair of Law and Environmental Policy at Cambridge University.

""This suggests a carbon bubble is forming and it is likely to burst.""

The fossil fuel industry is worth so much that it is borderline incomprehensible for the average person to wrap their mind around.

Today, there are nearly 1,500 oil and gas firms listed on stock exchanges around the world, and together they are worth a whopping $4.65 trillion. Exxon Mobil alone is worth $425 billion.

Using detailed simulations based on historical economic and environmental data, an international team of researchers has illustrated what could happen if this financial rug is pulled out from underneath us.

The research reveals that on our current trajectory, the fossil fuel industry will be forced to abandon vast reserves of fossil fuels sometime before 2035.

Overall, this would amount to a loss of between $1 trillion and $4 trillion in fossil fuel assets alone - roughly four to six times bigger than the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the loss of $0.25 trillion.

""Individual nations cannot avoid the situation by ignoring the Paris Agreement or burying their heads in coal and tar sands,"" said Vinuales.

""For too long, global climate policy has been seen as a prisoner's dilemma game, where some nations can do nothing and get a 'free ride' on the efforts of others. Our results show this is no longer the case.""

The study should set off alarm bells for major carbon exporters like the USA, Russia and Canada. The researchers have warned that if these countries continue to prop up their fossil fuel industries while neglecting green alternatives they will experience severe financial losses in the future.

The findings come one year after the Trump administration announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris accord, which seeks to curb emissions at 2 degrees Celsius.

Plus, just this month, President Trump announced his administration would be taking steps to bolster dying coal and nuclear power plants in the US.

Still, President Trump's policies are nothing new. To this day, the US continues to provide $27 billion in subsidies for the production and consumption of fossil fuels each year, the most of any industrialized nation, according to a recent report from the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC).

But if the US does not start divesting from fossil fuels and soon, the financial cost will be drastic. The study suggests that if fossil fuel demand declines and the Paris climate goals are met, an initial $4 trillion of fossil fuel assets will be lost completely.

The deficit will be nothing less than a global financial catastrophe, causing mass unemployment and political upheaval. The study's authors worry that the ensuing public turmoil will give rise to populist politics - something that has already been popping up recent in the US, the UK and Europe.

""If we are to defuse this time-bomb in the global economy, we need to move promptly but cautiously,"" said study co-author Hector Pollitt from Cambridge Econometrics.

""The carbon bubble must be deflated before it becomes too big, but progress must also be carefully managed.""

The researchers believe that China is poised to benefit the most if the carbon bubble does indeed pop.

""China is already a world leader in renewable energy technologies, and needs to deploy them domestically to tackle dangerous levels of pollution,"" said Vinuales.

""Additionally, stranding would take a higher toll on some of its main geopolitical competitors. China has a strong incentive to push for climate policies.""

The research suggests that if the US does not start divesting from fossil fuels, China will lead the way in future energy markets.

Baseline TV data were available for 1310 patients. The mean (SD) TV data in the smallest quartile (Q1) was 12.8 (1.18) cm 3 (n=294) and in the largest quartile (Q4) was 17.7 (0.75) cm 3 (n=358).

Patients in Q1 versus Q4 had more gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) lesions; 2.2 (3.56) versus 1.2 (2.96), and larger T2 (or bright white) lesion volume, 25.6 (18.01) versus 3.9 (4.22) cm 3 at baseline.

At month 24, the annual relapse rate was higher in Q1 patients than in Q4 in both groups, but ozanimod was associated with a lower mean ARR than interferon b-1a in both Q1 (0.25 vs 0.38) and Q4 (0.10 vs 0.27).

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulatory drug now under FDA review for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), appears to be more effective than interferon b-1a (Avonex) at slowing disease activity, based on an established brain measure taken during phase 3 of the RADIANCE trial.A poster featuring a post-hoc exploratory analysis of measures of thalamic volume (TV) from RADIANCE was presented September 11, 2019, at ECTRIMS 2019,the 35th Annual Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, taking place in Stockholm, Sweden.The study authors noted that whole brain volume is a known measure of disease progression in relapsing MS, yet ""evidence of the relationship between thalamic volume and disease activity in prospective, multicenter studies is sparse."" TV has been studied for years as a predictor of cognitive speed; a 2001 paper by Van Der Werf, et al, discussed how a decrease in TV ""was apparent before the onset of loss of volume of the total brain.""Relapsing MS occurs when inflammation damages myelin, a fatty substance that insulates nerve cells, and thus allows interference with nerve impulses, triggering MS symptoms. Ozanimod works by selectively binding 2 receptors--the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1PR) and the S1PRreceptors, which keeps immune cells from entering the brain and blocks inflammation of the central nervous system, so this inflammatory process does not occur.The investigational therapy has been studied in 2 doses, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, in a pair of phase 3 trials, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. The SUNBEAM trial featured 3 study arms: 1 arm each of patients taking the 2 doses of ozanimod and another taking interferon b-1a; full results of the 12-month study, first presented in 2017, were published last week in Lancet Neurology and show that ozanimod was well-tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon b-1a.RADIANCE was a 2-part trial to assess safety and efficacy of ozanimod compared with placebo. In the first part, 258 patients were randomly assigned to take 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of the study drug or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Patients taking ozanimod had fewer brain lesions after week 12, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as fewer relapses. During the second, open-label phase, 249 patients continued in the trial for 96 weeks. All those given ozanimod in the first phase stayed on their current dose, while those who had taken placebo were randomly assigned to either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg. Both groups were free of disease activity and brain lesions after 24 months. Patients from the original placebo group had a large drop in relapses once they started taking ozanimod.RADIANCE offered an opportunity use TV measures taken at baseline to compare the effectiveness of the study drug, ozanimod, against interferon b-1A. Data presented Wednesday found that in patients with relapsing MS, smaller baseline TV is a sign of a higher disease burden and increased disease activity after 2 years, compared with those with higher baseline TV.Specifically, the data presented Wednesday showed:US and European regulators are evaluating data from the multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 2/3 RADIANCE and the phase 3 SUNBEAM trials, which were submitted in March. FDA accepted Celgene's application for ozanimod June 6, 2019, and a decision is expected March 25, 2020.",0,0.0,0,0.0,Measure From RADIANCE Data Suggests Ozanimod More Effective in Slowing MS Disease Activity,"Mary Caffrey

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulatory drug now under FDA review for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), appears to be more effective than interferon b-1a (Avonex) at slowing disease activity, based on an established brain measure taken during phase 3 of the RADIANCE trial.A poster featuring a post-hoc exploratory analysis of measures of thalamic volume (TV) from RADIANCE was presented September 11, 2019, at ECTRIMS 2019,the 35th Annual Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, taking place in Stockholm, Sweden.The study authors noted that whole brain volume is a known measure of disease progression in relapsing MS, yet ""evidence of the relationship between thalamic volume and disease activity in prospective, multicenter studies is sparse."" TV has been studied for years as a predictor of cognitive speed; a 2001 paper by Van Der Werf, et al, discussed how a decrease in TV ""was apparent before the onset of loss of volume of the total brain.""Relapsing MS occurs when inflammation damages myelin, a fatty substance that insulates nerve cells, and thus allows interference with nerve impulses, triggering MS symptoms. Ozanimod works by selectively binding 2 receptors--the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1PR) and the S1PRreceptors, which keeps immune cells from entering the brain and blocks inflammation of the central nervous system, so this inflammatory process does not occur.The investigational therapy has been studied in 2 doses, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, in a pair of phase 3 trials, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. The SUNBEAM trial featured 3 study arms: 1 arm each of patients taking the 2 doses of ozanimod and another taking interferon b-1a; full results of the 12-month study, first presented in 2017, were published last week in Lancet Neurology and show that ozanimod was well-tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon b-1a.RADIANCE was a 2-part trial to assess safety and efficacy of ozanimod compared with placebo. In the first part, 258 patients were randomly assigned to take 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of the study drug or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Patients taking ozanimod had fewer brain lesions after week 12, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as fewer relapses. During the second, open-label phase, 249 patients continued in the trial for 96 weeks. All those given ozanimod in the first phase stayed on their current dose, while those who had taken placebo were randomly assigned to either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg. Both groups were free of disease activity and brain lesions after 24 months. Patients from the original placebo group had a large drop in relapses once they started taking ozanimod.RADIANCE offered an opportunity use TV measures taken at baseline to compare the effectiveness of the study drug, ozanimod, against interferon b-1A. Data presented Wednesday found that in patients with relapsing MS, smaller baseline TV is a sign of a higher disease burden and increased disease activity after 2 years, compared with those with higher baseline TV.Specifically, the data presented Wednesday showed:US and European regulators are evaluating data from the multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 2/3 RADIANCE and the phase 3 SUNBEAM trials, which were submitted in March.

A new study by Antoni Lewkowicz, a professor in the Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics at the University of Ottawa and published in the journal Nature Communications, however, shows that areas of cold permafrost can be vulnerable to rising summer temperatures.

Using a set of satellite images from the Google Earth Engine Timelapse dataset, Professor Lewkowicz and his co-author Robert Way recorded an astounding sixty-fold increase in the number retrogressive thaw slumps -- landslides caused by the melting of the ice in the permafrost -- on Banks Island over the past three decades. In 1984, there were about 60 active thaw slumps on the island. In 2013, there were more than 4,000, including about 300 initiated within Aulavik National Park. Overall, the area impacted by active slumping is now equivalent to that of the Island of Manhattan.

The analyses show that 85% of new landslides on Banks Island formed after four particularly hot summers (1998, 2010, 2011 and 2012), which caused the topmost layer of the permafrost to thaw. With global warming and rising temperatures, Professor Lewkowicz predicts a further increase in retrogressive thaw slumps: even under a relatively conservative scenario, there could be 10,000 new slumps per decade on Banks Island alone. Since these thaw slumps can keep growing for decades, Lewkowicz calculates that this could mean the island alone could be home to a staggering 30,000 active landslides in any future year.

The massive amount of sediment created by the slumps has choked some river valleys and affected more than 250 lakes on the island. According to Professor Lewkowicz, the impact on aquatic ecosystems and fish populations are unknown because there are no baseline data for the areas affected. Thaw slumps disturb ecosystems for extended periods and also release previously frozen organic material that will break down into carbon dioxide or methane, increasing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and causing further global warming.

The researchers were not the only ones to notice these dramatic changes. Residents of Sachs Harbour, a small Inuvialuit community on the island, had observed them first-hand. Thaw slumps and other landslides have affected their movements in certain parts of the island, making it harder to go hunting or fishing.

Scientists have created synthetic embryos in the laboratory using mouse cells. What makes these embryos special is that they were built without sperm and eggs.

Blastocyst

A few days after a mammal egg is fertilized, it develops into a blastocyst, a hollow sphere formed by a few cells divided into an outer layer that later develops into the placenta and a small cluster at the center, which develops into the future embryo.

In the new study published in the journal Nature on May 2, Nicolas Rivron, from Hubrecht Institutes in The Netherlands, and colleagues assembled stem cell lines that correspond to these sub-types in a manner that would trigger self-organization,

Bundles of mouse stem cells self-organized into proto-embryos initiating pregnancy when these were implanted into mouse wombs. These embryos in a dish that were attached to the womb lining of live mice grew for a few days.

""Here we report that trophoblast and embryonic stem cells cooperate in vitro to form structures that morphologically and transcriptionally resemble embryonic day 3.5 blastocysts, termed blastoids,"" researchers wrote in their study. ""Like blastocysts, blastoids form from inductive signals that originate from the inner embryonic cells and drive the development of the outer trophectoderm.""

Rivron and colleagues, however, did not expect that the procedure will produce a viable embryo. The experiment neither did so.

""This is a pity for basic research because it would be very useful to have a limitless supply of human blastocyst-like stage embryos to understand the relevant cell-cell interactions required to make normal embryos and to study mechanisms of implantation,"" said Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute in the United Kingdom.

""However, it may come as a relief to others that such a method of producing many genetically identical human embryo-like structures that might be capable of implantation is not feasible.

Failed Pregnancies

The breakthrough, however, could provide important insights into why many pregnancies fail at an early stage, during the implantation. Researchers said that the process may help with human fertility.

About two-thirds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments fail and this often happens during implantation in the uterus. The cause for this remains largely unknown.

""This breakthrough has opened up the black box of early pregnancy,"" said Rivron.

The researchers said that these early synthetic embryos all have the cell types needed for the formation of a whole organism.

""They will help us better understand the hidden processes at the start of life, to find solutions for fertility problems, and to develop new drugs without the use of lab animals.""

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Oct. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Brisk autumn winds and chilly winter temperatures may make you more vulnerable to heart trouble, a new study suggests.

Researchers found ""an increase in heart attacks in low temperature, strong wind, low sunshine duration and low atmospheric pressure,"" said senior author Dr. David Erlinge, head of cardiology at Lund University in Sweden.

However, the news isn't all worrisome.

The risk of heart attack decreased about 3 percent for every 13-degree Fahrenheit (F) increase in minimum air temperature, the study reports.

""It's important to note the overall effect here is quite modest,"" said Dr. Usman Baber, an assistant professor of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

The study involved more than 274,000 Swedes who had heart attacks between 1998 and 2013. Researchers looked up the weather on the day of each heart attack, to see if certain conditions appeared to make people more prone to heart problems.

Air temperature had the most profound effect on heart attack risk, with risk greater when the temperature dropped below 32 degrees F. But short days of sunshine, brisk winds and lower air pressure also were linked to increased risk.

The observed increase in heart attack risk could be due to weather's effect on the circulatory system, Erlinge explained.

""We know that cold and wind cause the body to contract the blood vessels of the skin to preserve temperature and energy,"" Erlinge said. ""This causes the heart to pump against higher resistance, which increases the stress on the heart and may trigger a heart attack.""

However, the study can't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, and Baber noted that many other factors may also be at play.

""I suspect the basis for this observed association is going to be more complex than that,"" Baber said. ""Physiology may play a role, but other factors like patient behavior that varies with weather might play a role.""

""When weather changes, people may behave differently,"" Baber continued. ""Maybe they are more stressed. Stress plays a major role in heart attack risk. Maybe people don't take medications as frequently.""

Reduced physical activity, dietary changes and depression are other behavioral factors that could influence seasonal heart attack risk, the researchers added.

Folks also might be more prone to respiratory infections and flu during this type of weather, and those illnesses are known risk factors for heart attack. For example, it's been shown that a respiratory infection can cause a six-fold increase in the risk of heart attack, the researchers noted.

If you're concerned about your heart health, take the time to slip on a sweater or jacket during brisk days, or bundle up when the mercury takes a deep dive, Erlinge said.

""If you are at high risk, you may avoid going out in really cold, windy weather,"" Erlinge added.

The study was published Oct. 24 in the journal JAMA Cardiology.

""We know that cold and wind cause the body to contract the blood vessels of the skin to preserve temperature and energy,"" Erlinge said. ""This causes the heart to pump against higher resistance, which increases the stress on the heart and may trigger a heart attack.""

However, the study can't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, and Baber noted that many other factors may also be at play.

""I suspect the basis for this observed association is going to be more complex than that,"" Baber said. ""Physiology may play a role, but other factors like patient behavior that varies with weather might play a role.""

""When weather changes, people may behave differently,"" Baber continued. ""Maybe they are more stressed. Stress plays a major role in heart attack risk. Maybe people don't take medications as frequently.""

Reduced physical activity, dietary changes and depression are other behavioral factors that could influence seasonal heart attack risk, the researchers added.

Folks also might be more prone to respiratory infections and flu during this type of weather, and those illnesses are known risk factors for heart attack. For example, it's been shown that a respiratory infection can cause a six-fold increase in the risk of heart attack, the researchers noted.

If you're concerned about your heart health, take the time to slip on a sweater or jacket during brisk days, or bundle up when the mercury takes a deep dive, Erlinge said.

""If you are at high risk, you may avoid going out in really cold, windy weather,"" Erlinge added.

The study was published Oct. 24 in the journal JAMA Cardiology.

A report published recently in the Journal of Controlled Release describes a technique for administering con",0.75,1,"Newswise -- Family planning for women might one day be as simple as putting on an earring.

A report published recently in the Journal of Controlled Release describes a technique for administering contraceptive hormones through special backings on jewelry such as earrings, wristwatches, rings or necklaces. The contraceptive hormones are contained in patches applied to portions of the jewelry in contact with the skin, allowing the drugs to be absorbed into the body.

Initial testing suggests the contraceptive jewelry may deliver sufficient amounts of hormone to provide contraception, though no human testing has been done yet. A goal for the new technique is to improve user compliance with drug regimens that require regular dosages. Beyond contraceptives, the jewelry-based technique might also be used for delivering other drugs through the skin.

""The more contraceptive options that are available, the more likely it is that the needs of individual women can be met,"" said Mark Prausnitz, a Regents Professor and the J. Erskine Love Jr. chair in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""Because putting on jewelry may already be part of a woman's daily routine, this technique may facilitate compliance with the drug regimen. This technique could more effectively empower some women to prevent unintended pregnancies.""

This proof-of-concept research was supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under a subcontract funded by FHI 360.

Contraceptive jewelry adapts transdermal patch technology that is already used to administer drugs that prevent motion sickness, support smoking cessation, and control the symptoms of menopause, but have never been incorporated into jewelry before. Contraceptive patches are also already available, but Prausnitz believes pairing them with jewelry may prove attractive to some women - and allow more discreet use of the drug delivery technology.

""There is a lot of experience with making and using conventional transdermal patches,"" he said. ""We are taking this established technology, making the patch smaller and using jewelry to help apply it. We think that earring patches can expand the scope of transdermal patches to provide additional impact.""

Postdoctoral Fellow Mohammad Mofidfar, Senior Research Scientist Laura O'Farrell and Prausnitz tested the concept on animal models, first on ears from pigs. Test patches mounted on earring backs and containing the hormone levonorgestrel were also applied to the skin of hairless rats. To simulate removal of the earrings during sleep, the researchers applied the patches for 16 hours, then removed them for eight hours. Testing suggested that even though levels dropped while the earrings were removed, the patch could produce necessary amounts of the hormone in the bloodstream.

The earring patch tested by the researchers consisted of three layers. One layer is impermeable and includes an adhesive to hold it onto an earring back, the underside of a wristwatch or the inside surface of a necklace or ring. A middle layer of the patch contains the contraceptive drug in solid form. The outer layer is a skin adhesive to help stick to skin so the hormone can be transferred. Once in the skin, the drug can move into the bloodstream and circulate through the body.

If the technique ultimately is used for contraception in humans, the earring back would need to be changed periodically, likely on a weekly basis.

The contraceptive jewelry was originally designed for use in developing countries where access to health care services may limit access to long-acting contraceptives such as injectables, implants and IUDs. However, Prausnitz says the technology may be attractive beyond that initial audience. ""We think contraceptive jewelry could be appealing and helpful to women all around the world,"" said Prausnitz.

The researchers tested patches adhered to earring backs, about one square centimeter in area, and placed them tightly on the skin of the test animals. Earring backs and watches may be most useful for administering drugs because they remain in close contact with the skin to allow drug transfer. The dose delivered by a patch is generally proportional to the area of skin contact.

""The advantage of incorporating contraceptive hormone into a universal earring back is that it can be paired with many different earrings,"" Prausnitz noted. ""A woman could acquire these drug-loaded earring backs and then use them with various earrings she might want to wear.""

Though transdermal drug-delivery patches have been available since 1979, testing would be required to determine whether the earring patch is safe and effective. In addition, research would be required to determine whether the concept would be attractive to women in different cultures.

""We need to understand not only the effectiveness and economics of contraceptive jewelry, but also the social and personal factors that come into play for women all around the world,"" Prausnitz said. ""We would have to make sure that this contraceptive jewelry concept is something that women would actually want and use.""

The technique could potentially be used to deliver other pharmaceuticals, though it would only be suitable for skin-permeable drugs that require administration of quantities small enough to fit into the patches.

""We think there are uses beyond contraceptive hormones, but there will always be a limitation that the drug has to be effective with a low enough dose to fit into the limited space in the patch,"" Prausnitz said. ""It also should be a drug that would benefit from continuous delivery from a patch and that is administered to a patient population interested in using pharmaceutical jewelry.""

The earring patch is designed to add another contraceptive option for women. ""Pharmaceutical jewelry introduces a novel delivery method that may make taking contraceptives more appealing,"" he added. ""Making it more appealing should make it easier to remember to use it.""

The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, however, has been working since the beginning of the year to trap tegus sighted in Toombs and Tattnall counties, DNR states on its website. It's also investigating reports of tegus in other parts of Georgia.

According to a report last year, much of the South and ""northern Mexico probably contains suitable habitat for one or more of these tegu species.""

>> It's illegal to own or kill most snakes in Georgia

Argentine black-and-white tegus can grow to be 4 feet long, weigh up to 10 pounds and live for 20 years. Because they are not native to Georgia, it is illegal to release them into the wild.

According to DNR, adult tegus have few predators and can multiply quickly. Females can reproduce when they reach about 12 inches long and can lay about 35 eggs a year.

Although they don't tend to be aggressive toward humans, they will defend themselves, DNR states. ""Tegus can react fast, and have sharp teeth and claws and strong jaws,"" its website states.

>> Why snakebites are on the rise in Georgia this year

The biggest threats are to Georgia's birds, small mammals and reptiles, and insects. Tegus are considered an invasive species, and also eat ""fruit, vegetables, plants, pet food, carrion and the eggs of chickens, ground-nesting birds, and other reptiles, including American alligators and gopher tortoises, both protected species.""

The large lizards haven't been spotted this far north yet, but DNR asks the public to let it know if you happen to see one. This helps biologists document occurrences. Note the location, take a photo and report the sighting:

The gold found in the eucalyptus trees is not that significant amount to have a cost-effective way to extract the gold. According to Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) geochemist Melvyn Lintern, ""If you had 500 eucalypt trees growing over a gold deposit, they would only have enough gold in there to make a wedding ring.""

The researchers analyzed the eucalyptus and acacia trees in Western Australia's Kalgoorlie region. They were able to see the gold particles, which are about one fifth the width of human hair, using CSIRO's Maia detector for X-ray elemental imaging. This tool which was located at Clayton's the Australian Synchrotron, allowed the researchers to find the gold in the cells and vascular system of the eucalyptus leaves.

According to the researchers, the precious metal were rejected by the plant which is why it was shed after getting deposited in the bark and leaves. Their discovery led them to believe that there is more of the gold where it came from, underneath the tree's roots which go as deep as 50 meters.

""There might be tons of gold underneath and yet the amount of gold in the tree is very small.'' Lintern told Brisbane Times.

This means that the study's findings would be significant for the mining industries. Precious metals and minerals like gold, copper and zinc will now have a more efficient, less expensive and safe way to find and detect deposits.

Exploration teams for mining companies can now benefit from the scientific researches on the leaves and barks of trees. They may be able to indicate the content of mineral deposits underneath the ground without even making the effort of digging deep into the ground, which is very costly in terms of time and money.

The research was specific to the eucalyptus leaf but the scientists believe that this method can also be done for other types of trees. As Dr. Lintern said, ""As far as we know, this is the first time that anyone has seen gold in any biological tissue and it just happens to be a eucalypt leaf.""

The study was published in the Oct. 22 issue of the online journal Nature Communications.",5,0.8333333333333334,0,0.0,Eucalyptus Trees Have Gold Particles in the Roots,"A new study discovered gold particles in the roots of eucalyptus trees.

The study was published in the Oct. 22 issue of the online journal Nature Communications.",http://www.hngn.com/articles/15577/20131023/eucalyptus-trees-have-gold-particles-in-the-roots.htm,"<div style=""width: 1000px; height: 600px; overflow-y:scroll;""> Please read the following unpublished science news drafted by a journalist and rate the statements below <hr size=""10""> <strong>Title :Eucalyptus Trees Have Gold Particles in the Roots</Strong> <br> <hr size=""2""> A new study discovered gold particles in the roots of eucalyptus trees. Researchers suggest trees as an indicator for new method to search for gold and other special metals.<br><br>The gold found in the eucalyptus trees is not that significant amount to have a cost-effective way to extract the gold. According to Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) geochemist Melvyn Lintern, ""If you had 500 eucalypt trees growing over a gold deposit, they would only have enough gold in there to make a wedding ring.""<br><br>The researchers analyzed the eucalyptus and acacia trees in Western Australia's Kalgoorlie region. They were able to see the gold particles, which are about one fifth the width of human hair, using CSIRO's Maia detector for X-ray elemental imaging. This tool which was located at Clayton's the Australian Synchrotron, allowed the researchers to find the gold in the cells and vascular system of the eucalyptus leaves.<br><br>According to the researchers, the precious metal were rejected by the plant which is why it was shed after getting deposited in the bark and leaves. Their discovery led them to believe that there is more of the gold where it came from, underneath the tree's roots which go as deep as 50 meters.<br><br>""There might be tons of gold underneath and yet the amount of gold in the tree is very small.'' Lintern told Brisbane Times.<br><br>This means that the study's findings would be significant for the mining industries. Precious metals and minerals like gold, copper and zinc will now have a more efficient, less expensive and safe way to find and detect deposits.<br><br>Exploration teams for mining companies can now benefit from the scientific researches on the leaves and barks of trees.

But new research finds there's a significant risk of misreading others' faces.

If you've done much traveling and interacted with other cultures, you may have noticed that appropriate facial expressions aren't necessarily a universal thing. While we've come to expect big smiles from servers in American restaurants, you're more often greeted with a neutral stare in many northern European countries and it's easy to mistake this for rudeness as a foreigner when it's really just the local social norm.

Now researchers at New York University say that it's also easy to misunderstand the expressions on faces of people from the same culture. They explain that our own pre-conceived understanding of the emotions we perceive on the faces of others influence how we interpret those expressions.

""These visual perceptions may differ across people depending on the unique conceptual beliefs we bring to the table,"" said professor Jonathan Freeman, senior author of a new paper in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. ""Our findings suggest that people vary in the specific facial cues they utilize for perceiving facial emotion expressions.""

The researchers set up an elaborate series of experiments designed to determine how participants see six key emotions on the faces of others: anger, disgust, happiness, fear, sadness, and surprise.

Many scientists have long held that these specific emotions are universal across societies and built into our biology along with the facial expressions that go along with each.

But the new research contrasts with these ideas and finds that our interpretation of expressions can say something about us as well as the face we're trying to read.

""The results suggest that we may all slightly differ in the facial cues we use to understand others' emotions, because they depend on how we conceptually understand these emotions,"" says Freeman.

The study authors believe their work could have implications for artificial intelligence and how machines spot emotions on human faces, but there's also a lesson to be learned for those of us non-computers.

It's probably best not to rely on your keen sense for reading people. A healthy dose of open and emotionally intelligent facial expression fact-checking is the best prescription.

If you think you're reading a negative emotion on the face of a prospective client, check that you're actually seeing what you think you are. This can be as simple as asking:

""I might be reading this wrong, but has something upset you?""

Or, a little more playfully:

""Just checking, but is that your angry or your surprised face?""

You get the idea. Just remember the key take away here: It's not a good idea to take any expression at face value.

Introduced by Republican Rep. Michelle Udall, the symbolic measure says pornography ""perpetuates a sexually toxic environment that damages all areas of our society,"" AZ Central reported.

Though there would be no legal implications, the measure could pave the way for future pornography regulation policy.

Democratic lawmakers objected to the measure's wide-ranging descriptions of pornography's negative effects.

State Lawmakers in Arizona are weighing a measure to declare pornography a public health crisis.

Introduced by Republican Rep. Michelle Udall, the measure says pornography ""perpetuates a sexually toxic environment that damages all areas of our society,"" AZ Central reported.

""Like the tobacco industry, the pornography industry has created a public health crisis,"" Udall reportedly told lawmakers. ""Pornography is used pervasively, even by minors.""

House Concurrent Resolution 2009 says children's easy access to online porn contributes to ""low self-esteem, eating disorders and an increase in problematic sexual activity at ever-younger ages.""

The proposal, which passed through the state's House Committee on Health & Human Services, has no legal implications but, if passed, could set a precedent for future pornography regulation policy.

If passed into law, the measure would make Arizona the 12th state to pass a resolution on pornography as a public health crisis.

In addition to self-esteem, the measure states that pornography can contribute to young viewers being exposed to ""toxic sexual behaviors, emotional, mental and medical illnesses and difficulty forming or maintaining intimate relationships.""

Pornography ""normalizes violence and the abuse of women and children by treating them as objects, increasing the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution and child porn,"" the measure reads.

The measure's statements on the negative effects of porn were met with resistance from Democratic lawmakers who objected to the wide-ranging language that described pornography's negative effects.

""There are statements in here that seem hyperbolic and unproven,"" said Democratic Rep. Kelli Butler. ""I just don't think there's necessarily the science to back up those claims.""

The true nature of pornography's potential for personally negative effects is the subject of widespread debate, as some interest groups contend it creates ""sexual harm"" and some research contends that pornography can damage relationships, though there is no national resolution on the matter.

AZ Central reported that supporters said the resolution was an important step in flagging pornography as a problem for increased awareness among parents and educators.

Despite the wealth of interest groups and lawmakers who have spoken out about the ""crisis,"" no states have passed laws against as a result of the measures, and the issue has sparked nearly two decades of legal battles in federal courts, with more attention paid to squashing the proliferation of child and revenge porn.

House Concurrent Resolution 2009 says children's easy access to online porn contributes to ""low self-esteem, eating disorders and an increase in problematic sexual activity at ever-younger ages.""

The proposal, which passed through the state's House Committee on Health & Human Services, has no legal implications but, if passed, could set a precedent for future pornography regulation policy.

An ABC News poll from last November suggests that most parents in America are fine with the practice of physical discipline. Sixty-five percent of Americans approve of spanking children as a means of discipline in their home.

That same poll seems to suggest people are not fine when someone else does the disciplining: only 26 percent said that teachers should be allowed to use physical punishment for kids in schools, while 72 percent of Americans (and 67 percent of parents) said that shouldn't happen.

Most parents said within that poll that they do occasionally spank their parents, with 50 percent admitting they do and 45 percent saying they don't. Corporal punishment of children isn't illegal in the United States, but a new recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics says the practice should stop if they care one iota about their kids' mental health. The group is also urging parents who do so to cease verbally abusing their children as well.

""Aversive disciplinary strategies, including all forms of corporal punishment and yelling at or shaming children, are minimally effective in the short-term and not effective in the long-term,"" the article abstract, published in Pediatrics, stated. ""With new evidence, researchers link corporal punishment to an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.""

Dr. Robert Sege, the first author on the new policy statement for the organization, explained how the policy against spanking children has changed in the past two decades, according to reporting from CNN.

""In the 20 years since that policy was first published, there's been a great deal of additional research, and we're now much stronger in saying that parents should never hit their child and never use verbal insults that would humiliate or shame the child.""

""This is much stronger than the previous advice,"" Sege added. ""The new policy encourages pediatricians to discuss the data about different kinds of discipline with parents so, of course, they can make their own decisions in how they chose to raise their children.""

Spanking doesn't have the outcomes that parents want it to have, the study suggested, adding that spanking especially aggressive children can lead to dire outcomes, including depression in adolescence. Corporal punishment is even linked to children having less gray matter in their brains.

That's a very important aspect that cannot go overlooked. In addition to aiding children with motor skills and other important life functions, additional studies have concluded that a person's intelligence might be directly related to the amount of gray matter that's floating around in their brain, according to the publication Nature. A depletion of gray matter could adversely affect how well kids are able to problem solve, for example, creating much greater problems as they grow older.

Spanking is deemed by the pediatricians in this most recent study as being detrimental to a kid's well-being, damaging their relationships with their parents, which are important to their future ability to forge relationships with others in the future, according to reporting from the New York Times. But does corporal punishment work at all?

Hardly.

Scientists have long suspected that respiratory virusesaEUR""the sort that cause common colds or bronchitisaEUR""play a critical role in the long-term development of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Studying mouse and cell models of this process, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis now have shown how immune cells dispatched to the lung to destroy a respiratory virus can fail to disperse after their job is finished, setting off a chain of inflammatory events that leads to long-term lung problems.

Understanding such details may help scientists find ways to block the accumulation of inflammatory immune cells and prevent progression to chronic lung disorders.

The study appears April 20 in The Journal of Experimental Medicine.

The findings stem from research into immune cells called macrophages.

aEURoeIn general, scientists thought this type of macrophage was involved in the repair of the lung,aEUR said senior author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine at the School of Medicine. aEURoeThat may be true in some cases. But like many things in nature, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.aEUR

When large numbers of this type of macrophage accumulate, they appear to stop orchestrating the immune response against acute viral infections and instead participate in a type of response that is more typically directed against parasites and allergens. Holtzman and his colleagues observed that macrophages producing this type of immune response also express a protein called TREM-2 at high levels.

The new work shows that the usual cell-surface form of TREM-2 is indeed needed to sustain the macrophages as they fight off viral infection and the early illness it causes. Then, after the initial infection is cleared, TREM-2 is cleaved from the outer surface of the macrophages. Previously, this cleaved form of the protein was thought to be inactive.

aEURoeWe were surprised to find that this cleaved form of TREM-2 is actually quite active,aEUR Holtzman said. aEURoeIt potently prevents the programmed death of macrophages, promoting their survival. So this form of TREM-2 allows for macrophages to hang around longer than they should.aEUR





Holtzman noted that TREM-2 enables a feed-forward process for inflammatory disease. Each new infection activates macrophages, which later produce the cleaved form of TREM-2. This form then promotes further macrophage accumulation and ultimately contributes to ongoing and progressive inflammatory disease.

Implicating TREM-2 in the harmful accumulation of inflammatory immune cells opens the door to exploring ways to block it, according to first author Kangyun Wu, PhD, a staff scientist.

Holtzman also pointed out that individual genetic variation in TREM-2 may explain why some people never develop chronic lung disease even after many viral lung infections.

While this study focused on the lung, Holtzman said TREM-2 could be involved in other inflammatory diseases in which the immune system is chronically activated in other organs.

Macrophage nuclei are shown in blue. Credit: Holtzman Lab



Scientists have long suspected that respiratory virusesaEUR""the sort that cause common colds or bronchitisaEUR""play a critical role in the long-term development of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Studying mouse and cell models of this process, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis now have shown how immune cells dispatched to the lung to destroy a respiratory virus can fail to disperse after their job is finished, setting off a chain of inflammatory events that leads to long-term lung problems.

Understanding such details may help scientists find ways to block the accumulation of inflammatory immune cells and prevent progression to chronic lung disorders.

The study appears April 20 in The Journal of Experimental Medicine.

The findings stem from research into immune cells called macrophages.

aEURoeIn general, scientists thought this type of macrophage was involved in the repair of the lung,aEUR said senior author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine at the School of Medicine. aEURoeThat may be true in some cases. But like many things in nature, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.aEUR

When large numbers of this type of macrophage accumulate, they appear to stop orchestrating the immune response against acute viral infections and instead participate in a type of response that is more typically directed against parasites and allergens. Holtzman and his colleagues observed that macrophages producing this type of immune response also express a protein called TREM-2 at high levels.

The new work shows that the usual cell-surface form of TREM-2 is indeed needed to sustain the macrophages as they fight off viral infection and the early illness it causes. Then, after the initial infection is cleared, TREM-2 is cleaved from the outer surface of the macrophages. Previously, this cleaved form of the protein was thought to be inactive.

aEURoeWe were surprised to find that this cleaved form of TREM-2 is actually quite active,aEUR Holtzman said. aEURoeIt potently prevents the programmed death of macrophages, promoting their survival. So this form of TREM-2 allows for macrophages to hang around longer than they should.aEUR

Three years ago the genetic analysis of a little finger bone from Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains in northern Asia led to a complete genome sequence of a new line of the human family tree - the Denisovans. Since then, genetic evidence pointing to their hybridisation with modern human populations has been detected, but only in Indigenous populations in Australia, New Guinea and surrounding areas. In contrast, Denisovan DNA appears to be absent or at very low levels in current populations on mainland Asia, even though this is where the fossil was found.

Wallace's Line marks the division between European and Asian mammals to the west from marsupial-dominated Australasia to the east.

The crossings were originally put in place to allow wildlife to continue travelling in the forest around the fenced highways and reduce the number of wildlife-vehicles collisions. Banff has a total of 44 highway crossings, consisting of 38 underpasses and six overpasses and since their construction, Parks Canada has found that wildlife-vehicle collisions in Banff National Park were reduced by 80 percent. The Wildlife Collision Prevention Program estimates that in Canada, there are four to eight large animal vehicle collisions every hour. Large animals consist of moose, elk, wolves, lynxes, cougars, deer and coyotes. When collisions between these animals and vehicles occur, it can sometimes be fatal for all parties involved.

The new study, carried out by Ecologist Mike Sawaya, along with the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University, has found that animals often use the crossings which enables them to roam freely in their territories to forage, hunt, or in the bear's case, find new mates. Researchers collected hair samples from the Banff National Park's highway crossings to see if the bears were isolated on each side or using the crossing effectively, for example, to find mates. They found that black bears, as well as grizzlies, were indeed using the crossway to find food as well as mates. Using a parentage test, researchers found that 27 percent of grizzlies that used the highway crossing had successfully bred, along with 47 percent of black bears. One black bear in particular, mated with five other females while travelling back and forth on the crossing and fathered 11 cubs. Sawaya comments that the male has figured out that the crossing has given him new breeding opportunities and is taking advantage of it. Before the crossings were constructed, ecologists were concerned that the bear population would start to become inbred. Without new mates, bears would have no choice but to breed inside smaller circles, causing less diversity and weaker genetics.

Getting the bears used to the idea of highway crossings takes money, time and patience. The crossings are no small endeavor as the overpasses can cost upwards of $2 million - $4 million to build and landscape. However, the underpasses are cheaper at roughly 10 percent of the cost of the overpasses. The bears in Banff National Park took their time to adjust to the crossings as researchers estimate that it was roughly five years before the bears to began to use them frequently. The time and money that has to be put into crossings has made some doubtful on whether they should be implemented in other national parks. Sawaya strongly believes that they have proven to be effective and are worth the price by saying ""we've given enough evidence now to show that they work."" Many agree with Sawaya that if the Banff National Park bears use highway crossings to find mates, and the highway crossings reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions, as well as encourage healthy mating amongst bears, then the $2 million - $4 million is worth it. The Traffic Industry Research Foundation estimates that wildlife-vehicle collisions cost roughly $200 million a year in Canada alone and can also have severe consequences by endangering some species, thus affecting biodiversity in the parks - not to mention the severe injuries and fatalities suffered by drivers annually.

The reason goals are so hard to reach, many psychologists think, is because each person believes they are really two people: Present Me and Future Me. And to most people, Future Me is much less important than Present Me. Present Me is the CEO of Me Corp, while Future Me is a lowly clerk.

""Instead of delaying gratification,"" people ""act as if they prefer their current self's needs and desires to those of their future self,"" write psychologists Neil Lewis of the University of Michigan and Daphna Oyserman of the University of Southern California in a new study in Psychological Science. Why put that money in your 401(k) when you want those shoes now? Why not eat that cupcake today when swimsuit season is still a good six weeks away?

So Oyserman and Lewis asked themselves: What if people could be made to think of their future selves as more connected to their current selves? What if Present Me was forced to imagine exactly how Future Me will feel the night before the big paper is due, and Present Me had never bothered to start?

Through a series of experiments, Oyserman and Lewis found that if subjects thought about a far-off event in terms of days, rather than months or years, they seemed like they would happen sooner. For example, the authors write, something like a friend's wedding ""seemed 16.3 days sooner when considered in days rather than months and 11.4 months sooner when considered in months rather than years.""

In a series of follow-ups, the researchers sought to determine whether people would take action sooner if they were told a certain event was happening in X days rather than (X/365) years. For example, participants were told to imagine they had a newborn child, and that the child will need to go to college in either 18 years or 6,570 days. The researchers found those in the ""days"" condition planned to start saving a whopping four times sooner than those in the ""years"" condition, even when controlling for income, age, and self-control.

Thinking about far-off events in terms of days, it turned out, did make a person more able to feel for his or her future self--a self who has, after all, the same wants and needs. Perhaps those Rent kids were onto something when they measured a year in 525,600 minutes.",5,1.6666666666666667,0,0.0,The Mechanics of Preventing Procrastination,"A new study finds that thinking about far-off events in terms of days, rather than years, makes people get started sooner.Procrastination is, in essence, stealing from yourself.

For example, the authors write, something like a friend's wedding ""seemed 16.3 days sooner when considered in days rather than months and 11.4 months sooner when considered in months rather than years.""In a series of follow-ups, the researchers sought to determine whether people would take action sooner if they were told a certain event was happening in X days rather than (X/365) years. For example, participants were told to imagine they had a newborn child, and that the child will need to go to college in either 18 years or 6,570 days. The researchers found those in the ""days"" condition planned to start saving a whopping four times sooner than those in the ""years"" condition, even when controlling for income, age, and self-control.Thinking about far-off events in terms of days, it turned out, did make a person more able to feel for his or her future self--a self who has, after all, the same wants and needs.

shows there are much greater attitude and behavior differences within generations than between generations.

The researchers studied over 600,000 people across an eight-year span. (How's that for establishing a statistically significant sample size?)

What did they find?

""The magnitude of generational differences is small to near-zero.""

In fact, only 2 percent of an individual's attitude can be attributed to their generation.

Ninety-eight percent of how we think, feel, and behave has absolutely nothing to do with our age group. That means two Millennials are likely to have greater differences between them than, for example, a Millennial and a Baby Boomer.

Which makes it odd that a seminar I recently attended claimed it would teach me everything I needed to know about supervising, managing, and leading Millennial employees.

Like:

Positive reinforcement and encouragement will get the best out of Millennials (and if I do have to give constructive feedback, I should first find a way to spin it in positive terms) because where Millennials are concerned, positive feedback is everything.

will get the best out of Millennials (and if I do have to give constructive feedback, I should first find a way to spin it in positive terms) because where Millennials are concerned, positive feedback is everything. Flex hours, flex workdays, flex workloads --flex everything--is the best way to engage and retain Millennials, because to Millennials, flexibility is all-important.

--flex everything--is the best way to engage and retain Millennials, because to Millennials, flexibility is all-important. Millennials want but are much less likely to ask for training opportunities than other age groups (they supposedly expect opportunities to be given, not requested). In order to grow their skills, managers need to create and implement formal development plans.

Those are just some highlights. I really didn't learn anything useful.

Granted, Millennials are different. But so are Boomers. And Gen-Z. But is it possible that every Millennial has the same preferences and characteristics?

Of course not. Millennials are different, I'm different, but more to the point, people are different. Every person brings a different set of goals, experiences, skills, talents, and perspectives.

That means every individual has a different--better yet, an ideal--way they should be treated, managed, and led.

No one, Millennial or not, responds to criticism the same way. No one, Millennial or not, seeks the same types of latitude, autonomy, and flexibility. No one seeks the same types of training, the same types of opportunities, or has the same willingness to step forward to ask for those opportunities.

So I didn't really learn anything because all I was told is how to manage generalizations and stereotypes, and that guidance, while sparking some interesting discussions, isn't helpful.

Leaders may be responsible for managing groups, but leaders ultimately lead individuals.

And every individual is different.

So what is the best way to lead a Millennial employee? Start by forgetting his or her age. Ignore stereotypes. Ignoring sweeping generalizations.

And then focus on the person.

For example, Millennials may appreciate positive reinforcement (who doesn't?), but what matters is how each individual responds to recognition.

Some people enjoy public praise. Others cringe when made the center of attention. Some people might appreciate just a quiet word of thanks.

Your job is to find out what makes the greatest impact for each individual, and provide that.

Another example: Millennials value flexibility (who doesn't?), but what matters is the kind of flexibility each individual values. One may appreciate flexible hours; another may appreciate occasionally working from home; another may love the option of carving out meeting-free blocks of time.

Your job is to find out what each individual values in terms of flexibility and latitude, and provide that.

One more example: Millennials want training and development (who doesn't?), but what matters is the kinds of opportunities each individual seeks, and how they best learn.

Formal training is great for some. But others want the freedom to step in and help and learn on the job.

Your job is to find out what each individual hopes to achieve, and provide that.

Millennial employees aren't one-size-fits-all. Accepting sweeping generalizations is dangerous because it allows us to think we're doing the right things, when, in fact, we're not.

Instead, forget the fact one employee is a Millennial. Forget the fact another is Gen-Z. Age differences are only a small slice of what makes each individual different. To lead, you must first take the time to truly know the person and then adapt how you lead to the interests, needs, and goals of that individual.

That's how you lead Millennial employees.

That's how you lead every employee, because the age group doesn't matter.

Where great leadership is concerned, what truly matters is knowing and adapting to the different needs, interests, and goals of each person on your team.

And that's why I promise to never write another article about managing Millennials--or managing any group based on age, gender, or other overly broad categorization.

""Our study adds to evidence on the health benefits of breast feeding by showing that there may be lifelong social benefits,"" wrote the British research team.

The researchers looked at data on 17,419 people born in Britain in 1958 and another 16,771 born in 1970 -- comparing their social class at the age of 10 or 11 to that aged 33/34, and whether or not they had been breastfed.

Social class was categorised on a four-point scale ranging from unskilled or semi-skilled to professional or managerial.

In the 1958 group, 68 percent had been breastfed compared with only 36 percent in the 1970 group, said the study, which claims to be the largest yet to probe the relationship between breastfeeding and social mobility.

The researchers gathered data during regular follow-ups every few years and took into account a range of other potential factors such as brain development and emotional stress levels.

""Intellect and stress accounted for around a third (36%) of the total impact of breastfeeding: breastfeeding enhances brain development, which boosts intellect, which in turn increases upwards social mobility. Breastfed children also showed fewer signs of stress,"" said a statement.

The authors said breast milk contained so-called long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids or LCPUFA's, which were essential for brain development.

Previous studies, however, have suggested that LCPUFA's alone may not improve cognitive growth

The team said it was impossible to tell which was more beneficial to the child: the nutrients found in breast milk, the skin-go-skin contact and bonding between a nursing mother and her infant, or perhaps a combination of the two.

Now research from the University of Utah and the University of Arizona has confirmed just how common such behavior is.

In a new study published in the Journal of Communication, researchers analyzed more than 6,400 reader comments posted to the website of the Arizona Daily Star, the major daily newspaper in Tucson, Arizona. They found that more than 1 in 5 comments included some form of incivility, with name-calling as the most prevalent type.

""We tracked six different kinds of uncivil language, but name-calling was far and away the most common,"" said Kevin Coe, assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah and one of the study's authors. ""Many people just can't seem to avoid the impulse to go after someone else.""

The study also showed that these types of commenters do not fit the stereotype of a few angry individuals who spend hours at their computers blasting others and making baseless claims. In fact, incivility was more common among infrequent commenters. Equally surprising, uncivil commenters were just as likely to use evidence in support of their claims as were the more respectful individuals.

As might be expected, stories that focused on well-known leaders with clear partisan positions garnered more impolite comments. In stories that quoted President Barack Obama, for example, nearly 1 in 3 comments were uncivil.

Disrespectful comments also tended to spike in discussions about weightier issues, such as politics, the economy, crime and taxes. The one exception to this trend was sports articles, which generated the highest percentage of these types of comments.

""Being a sports fan myself, this didn't surprise me,"" said Coe. ""Honestly, the only online incivility I've ever been guilty of was probably sports-related.""

The researchers noted one cause for optimism in their findings. When one commenter was directly replying to another commenter, they were more likely to be courteous.

""We tend to be more respectful in our public discourse when we recognize other citizens' perspectives, even when we do not agree with them,"" noted Kate Kenski, associate professor of communication at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study.

Now research from the University of Utah and the University of Arizona has confirmed just how common such behavior is.<br><br>In a new study published in the Journal of Communication, researchers analyzed more than 6,400 reader comments posted to the website of the Arizona Daily Star, the major daily newspaper in Tucson, Arizona. They found that more than 1 in 5 comments included some form of incivility, with name-calling as the most prevalent type.<br><br>""We tracked six different kinds of uncivil language, but name-calling was far and away the most common,"" said Kevin Coe, assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah and one of the study's authors. ""Many people just can't seem to avoid the impulse to go after someone else.""<br><br>The study also showed that these types of commenters do not fit the stereotype of a few angry individuals who spend hours at their computers blasting others and making baseless claims. In fact, incivility was more common among infrequent commenters. Equally surprising, uncivil commenters were just as likely to use evidence in support of their claims as were the more respectful individuals.<br><br>As might be expected, stories that focused on well-known leaders with clear partisan positions garnered more impolite comments. In stories that quoted President Barack Obama, for example, nearly 1 in 3 comments were uncivil.<br><br>Disrespectful comments also tended to spike in discussions about weightier issues, such as politics, the economy, crime and taxes. The one exception to this trend was sports articles, which generated the highest percentage of these types of comments.<br><br>""Being a sports fan myself, this didn't surprise me,"" said Coe. ""Honestly, the only online incivility I've ever been guilty of was probably sports-related.""<br><br>The researchers noted one cause for optimism in their findings.

""My sort of addictions jump. They jump around,"" Pinkett Smith, 46, said on the show Monday. ""When I was younger, I definitely think I had a sex addiction of some kind, yes--that everything could be fixed by sex. You know what I'm saying?""

The World Health Organization (WHO) added compulsive sexual behavior disorder to its latest classification of diseases on Monday. The condition stems from an inability to control sexual urges and impulses, and has been estimated to affect 3 to 6 percent of adults in the United States.

However, the notion of someone being addicted to sex remains controversial. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard guide for American psychiatrists, does not include the term ""sex addiction"" because ""clinicians and researchers agree there is not enough empirical evidence to support this diagnosis,"" according to Psychology Today.

Pinkett Smith, whose mother suffered from drug abuse, did not say if she was ever officially diagnosed with sex addition or compulsive sexual behavior disorder.

Compulsive sexual behavior can be caused by various factors, including chemical imbalances in the brain, according to Mayo Clinic. People who are hypersexual typically experience recurrent, intense sexual fantasies, urges and behaviors that feel uncontrollable and disrupt their life. The most common treatment option is therapy.

Pinkett Smith also spoke about her struggles with drinking and said she hit ""rock bottom"" when she tried to drink a third bottle of wine while home alone. She said she decided to curb the behavior immediately.

""I went cold turkey. That's the thing about me: I can go cold turkey. I am a binger, and I always have to watch myself, and I can just get obsessed with things,"" Pinkett Smith explained. ""It's not what you're doing but how you're with it. Why you're doing it. It's the behavior that's attached to it, because if you want to have a lot of sex, that's great, but why are you having all that sex? That's what you've got to look at.""

WHO's decision to classify compulsive sexual behavior disorder may be highly beneficial to sufferers. ""It is a behavior that tends to be hidden, as it's shameful, and often sex addicts don't come forward,"" Dr. Valerie Voon, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told The Sun. ""Adding this to the WHO list is an excellent step for patients, as it allows them to recognize that they are suffering from a problem--it takes it out of the shadows, and they are able to seek help for it.""

As described in an open-access paper in the journal Nature Communications, The catalyst shows a he catalytic performance is markedly better than that of commercial platinum catalyst, with an overpotential of only -12 mV to reach the current density of 10 mV cm-2 in 1 M KOH and -47 mV in 0.1 M KOH.

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a significant role in electrochemical water splitting for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy. In practice, room-temperature water electrolysis can be performed in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, where platinum-based nanoparticles generally serve as the catalysts of choice. Whereas numerous studies have been carried out in acid, the high cost of proton exchange membranes as well as the sluggish electron-transfer kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media have greatly hampered the widespread applications of acidic water electrolyzers. Such issues can be mitigated when the reactions are carried out in alkaline media, where HER involves three key steps ... ... alkaline water electrolysis come with a significant disadvantage of its own, which is the markedly diminished HER electron-transfer kinetics catalyzed by platinum (about two orders of magnitude lower than that in acid). Thus it is of both fundamental and technological significance to improve the performance of Pt-based HER catalysts6 or develop viable alternatives that are of low cost and high performance for HER electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolytes (e.g., transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, and phosphides). Toward this end, non-platinum noble metals, such as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and iridium, have also been attracting particular attention because of their apparent performances. Of these, ruthenium, in the form of nanoparticles, alloys, and oxides, has been found to display an HER activity that is comparable to that of commercial platinum catalysts in alkaline solutions. ... Herein, we prepared a nanocomposite based on ruthenium and nitrogen codoped carbons and examined the impacts of both ruthenium nanoparticles and atomic ruthenium sites on the HER performance. --Lu et al.

Electron microscopy and elemental mapping analysis of the new catalyst material showed ruthenium nanoparticles as well as individual ruthenium atoms within the carbon matrix. The researchers found that the main sites of catalytic activity were single ruthenium atoms rather than ruthenium nanoparticles.

That was a breakthrough, because many studies have attributed the catalytic activity to ruthenium nanoparticles. We found that single atoms are the dominant active sites, although both nanoparticles and single atoms contribute to the activity. --first author Bingzhang Lu, a graduate student in Chen's lab at UC Santa Cruz

Lu worked with coauthor Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to do theoretical calculations showing why ruthenium single atoms are more active catalytic centers than ruthenium nanoparticles.

Chen said he has filed a patent application for the experimental preparation of ruthenium-based catalysts. He noted that, in addition to potential applications for hydrogen production as part of sustainable energy systems, alkaline water electrolysis is already widely used in the chemical industry, as is a related process called chlor-alkali electrolysis for which the ruthenium catalyst could also be used. Thus a large market already exists for cheaper, more efficient catalysts.

Platinum catalysts are much more effective in acidic media than they are in alkaline media. The ruthenium-based catalysts perform almost as well as platinum in acidic media, while outperforming platinum in alkaline media, Chen said.

In future work, the researchers will seek to maximize the number of active sites in the material. They may also investigate the use of other metals in the same nanocomposite platform, he said.

In addition to Chen, Lu, and Ping, the coauthors of the paper include Lin Guo, Feng Wu, Yi Peng, Jia En Lu, and Tyler Smart at UC Santa Cruz; Nan Wang at South China University of Technology; Zou Finfrock at Canadian Light Source; David Morris and Peng Zhang at Dalhousie University; and Ning Li and Peng Gao at Peking University.

Scientists have long sought to understand the driving forces in this meticulously choreographed dance, in which each cell seems to know precisely where to be to at any given time, and with what other cells it must link.

In particular, intensive research has been focused on axon guidance, a process in which a neuron sends a wiry extension to seek out a partner cell and connect to it. In a study published today in Science, Rockefeller University researchers report on their discovery of a molecule secreted by cells in the spinal cord that helps guide axons during a critical stage of central nervous system (CNS) development.

""A type of cell called a commissural neuron projects axons from one side of the nervous system to the other, across an embryonic structure known as the midline,"" explains Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who led the research. Tessier-Lavigne is the Carson Family Professor and head of the Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair, and President of Rockefeller University. Working in mice, Tessier-Lavigne, postdoctoral fellow Alexander Jaworski (now on the faculty at Brown University), and their collaborators identified the new axon guidance factor, NELL2, and elucidated how it makes commissural axons creep toward the midline, and how the axons then depart from this area to reach their final destination.

A complex path

Commissural neurons build circuits that connect the right and left sides of the CNS. A number of inborn diseases have been linked to early developmental failures in which commissural axons lose their way and make inappropriate connections.

In the past two decades, work led by Tessier-Lavigne and others has identified a number of cell-secreted molecules -- including two groups of proteins called Netrins and Slits-that direct the routes of these axons. These factors can directionally attract or repel axons by binding to receptors on their tips. But scientists still have an incomplete understanding of how neurons receive and integrate inputs from several guidance cues at once, or how their responsiveness to certain factors changes over time.

""For example, commissural neurons are able to get to the midline because they are attracted there by certain factors, including Netrins,"" Tessier-Lavigne says. ""But once they've crossed the midline, they need to move on, and to do so the neurons somehow switch off their sensitivity to the attractants. At the same time, the neurons become sensitive to repelling factors in the midline, such as Slits. This prevents them from backtracking and helps them move forward.""

Focusing on the Robo3 receptor

From previous work, the researchers knew that a receptor protein called Robo3 is a key controller of the switch in which commissural neurons are initially attracted to the midline and then begin to avoid it. They also knew that it did so by boosting the action of attractants (Netrins) and blocking the action of repellents (Slits).

In the current study, which began while Tessier-Lavigne and Jaworski were at Genentech and was continued at Rockefeller, the researchers made the unexpected discovery that Robo3 has a third action that dovetails with the first two. By biochemically isolating proteins that bind to Robo3 from a vast pool of cell-secreted factors, they found that a protein called NELL2 binds to Robo3. In a series of mouse experiments, they were able to show that NELL2 is present in the developing spinal cord and directs the paths of commissural axons through repulsion by activating Robo3 receptors.

""We found that NELL2 is an axon-repulsion factor that helps the axon get to the midline,"" Tessier-Lavigne says. ""The Robo3 receptor therefore receives and coordinates input from not one but at least three diverse signaling molecules -- NELL2, Netrins, and Slits -- to fine tune an axon's journey across and away from the midline.""

The findings not only shed new light on the biology of axon guidance in a general sense, but could also help scientists understand what goes wrong in a rare disease called horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis, which has been linked to mutations in the gene that codes for Robo3. People affected by the condition often suffer from abnormal spine curvature, and are unable to move their eyes horizontally from side to side -- complications that arise early in development when commissural axons fail to cross the midline.

Researchers at the University of Oxford surveyed around 1,000 British 14 and 15-year-olds and their parents or guardians to test the view held by some that there is a link between the games and aggressive behaviour.

They said the results, published in Royal Society Open Science, did not support claims of connection.

The study was led by Professor Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute.

He told Sky News: ""What we found was that there are a lot of things that feed in to aggression.

""There are some effects of gender and some people who are from different life backgrounds have higher or lower ratings, but video game play didn't really seem to matter here.""

For the study, the teenagers provided reports of their recent gaming experiences.

The violent contents of the games were categorised using official EU and US ratings.

Their parents or guardians then provided accounts of the teens' ""aggressive behaviours"" in the previous month.

The researchers then assessed if recent violent game play was positively related to aggressive behaviour in the parents or guardians' accounts.

Prof Przybylski said: ""Violent games don't seem to drive aggressive behaviour in young people.

Imagine being stuffed into a crowded train car and noticing a less crowded one just down the platform. You'd probably want to move over as soon as possible. Particles that follow this balancing act--known as osmosis--spontaneously move from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. Now, scientists have used this tendency to create a power-producing membrane that can harvest electric current from nothing but salty water.

When ionic salts, made of bundles positively and negatively charged particles, dissolve in water, the bundles break apart, leaving positively and negatively charged particles free to participate in osmosis. By placing charged, thin membranes in between salty water and freshwater, scientists can create an expressway for the flowing particles, generating electric current. But these membranes are often expensive to manufacture and they tend to get leaky over time. That lets particles pass back through in the wrong direction, cutting into how much electricity they can produce.

Now, researchers have developed a new kind of gatekeeper--a ""two-faced"" membrane that has different properties on either side, from the size of the pores to the charge of the membrane itself. This encourages a steady flow of charged particles from one side to the other while preventing them from drifting back in the wrong direction. These so-called Janus membranes, named after the ancient Roman god of gates and passages, can also be manufactured to have different-size pores and hold different charges, allowing them to accept different kinds of particles.

The researchers tested their Janus membranes with salty sea water on one side and fresh river water on the other. They found the devices were able to convert 35.7% of the chemical energy stored in the salty water into useable electricity. That's as efficient as most wind turbines and higher than most solar cells, they report today in Science Advances .

Next, the researchers plan to build larger membranes and see whether they can withstand the conditions of real sea and river water. If the membrane performs as well in ""the wild,"" the new membranes could be used to power remote communities with no other sources of renewable energy in just a few years, the researchers say.

Medication Assisted Treatment Lowers Risk of Fatal Overdoses, Improves Long-Term OutcomesNews provided byJun 14, 2018, 02:39 ETShare this articleWASHINGTON, June 14, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Following emergency care for an opioid overdose, an emergency department-facilitated transition to outpatient care is more likely to lead to healthier patient outcomes when it begins with Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) in the emergency department, according to a review of current evidence published in Annals of Emergency Medicine. One reason MAT is so important is that many patients do not seek or receive further treatment in the outpatient setting after an opioid overdose-related emergency visit, according to ""Identification, Management and Transition of Care for Patients With Opioid Use Disorder in the Emergency Department,"" a new analysis in Annals of Emergency Medicine. Expanding patient access to MAT helps avoid a potential treatment gap and eases entry into appropriate outpatient care. MAT refers to addiction treatment with medications, most commonly buprenorphine, although it is most effective when combined with behavioral therapy and counseling.""Early initiation of MAT in the emergency department significantly affects the likelihood that a patient with opioid use disorder will engage in health services and go on to show long-term health improvements,"" said Herbie Duber MD, MPH, University of Washington Division of Emergency Medicine and lead study author. ""We have to meet patients where they are. If we don't provide treatment options like MAT it could be a missed opportunity to save a patient's life. Coordinated care for complex chronic conditions is proven to be effective; treating opioid use disorder should be no different.""  MAT improves long-term outcomes for patients, the authors note. Specifically, patients who receive opioid agonist therapy as part of treatment for opioid use disorder have a decreased chance of fatal overdose compared with those who receive psychological counseling alone. Patients maintained on buprenorphine have fewer emergency visits and hospitalizations. And, patients who received MAT in the emergency department are more likely after 30 days to be engaged in addiction treatment and less likely to abuse opioids than those with counseling alone, the study cites. But, the authors point out, there are still many challenges when attempting to connect patients to continued care. Resource constraints, lack of available support services in the emergency department or lack of nearby outpatient services add complexity to facilitating comprehensive care. ""A comprehensive treatment strategy is better for patients, and ideally it should include what is known as a 'warm handoff' between providers,"" said Dr. Duber. ""Clear communication between the acute care team, additional specialists and the patient is essential to minimize the chance of withdrawal or relapse."" The authors make recommendations for opioid abuse screening, treatment and referrals in the emergency department. These include (1) targeted (rather than universal) screenings of individuals at-risk for opioid use disorder; (2) using prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) in conjunction with other self-administered screening tools to assess risk of opioid use disorder; (3) considering ED-initiated MAT with buprenorphine for patients who are identified to have opioid use disorder; (4) routinely providing patients with a naloxone rescue kit, or a prescription for a kit, with instructions for proper use; and (5) developing systems of care that facilitate patient transitions to treatment outside of the emergency department. ""The ability to administer MAT in the emergency department is critical,"" said Paul Kivela, MD, MBA, FACEP, president of ACEP. ""Interventions that rely on emergency department expertise should include collaboration with a range of community care providers and span prevention, treatment and recovery.""""We are seeing some success, but the challenge is that many emergency departments require additional resources to implement these programs,"" Dr. Kivela said.

Researchers have developed an artificial sensory nerve system that can activate the twitch reflex in a cockroach and identify letters in the Braille alphabet.

The work, reported in Science, is a step toward creating artificial skin for prosthetic limbs, to restore sensation to amputees and, perhaps, one day give robots some type of reflex capability.

""We take skin for granted but it's a complex sensing, signaling, and decision-making system,"" says Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford University and one of the senior authors. ""This artificial sensory nerve system is a step toward making skin-like sensory neural networks for all sorts of applications.""

A step towards mimicking skin

This milestone is part of Bao's quest to mimic how skin can stretch, repair itself, and, most remarkably, act like a smart sensory network that knows not only how to transmit pleasant sensations to the brain, but also when to order the muscles to react reflexively to make prompt decisions.

The new paper describes how the researchers constructed an artificial sensory nerve circuit that could be embedded in a future skin-like covering for neuro-prosthetic devices and soft robotics. This rudimentary artificial nerve circuit integrates three previously described components.

The first is a touch sensor that can detect even minuscule forces. This sensor sends signals through the second component--a flexible electronic neuron. The touch sensor and electronic neuron are improved versions of inventions the Bao lab previously reported.

Sensory signals from these components stimulate the third component, an artificial synaptic transistor modeled after human synapses. The synaptic transistor is the brainchild of Tae-Woo Lee of Seoul National University, who spent his sabbatical year in Bao's Stanford lab to initiate the work.

""Biological synapses can relay signals, and also store information to make simple decisions,"" says Lee, who is a second senior author on the paper. ""The synaptic transistor performs these functions in the artificial nerve circuit.""

Lee used a knee reflex as an example of how more-advanced artificial nerve circuits might one day be part of an artificial skin that would give prosthetic devices or robots both senses and reflexes.

In humans, when a sudden tap causes the knee muscles to stretch, certain sensors in those muscles send an impulse through a neuron. The neuron in turn sends a series of signals to the relevant synapses. The synaptic network recognizes the pattern of the sudden stretch and emits two signals simultaneously, one causing the knee muscles to contract reflexively and a second, less urgent signal to register the sensation in the brain.

Testing the system

The new work has a long way to go before it reaches that level of complexity. But in their paper, the group describes how the electronic neuron delivered signals to the synaptic transistor, which they engineered in such a way that it learned to recognize and react to sensory inputs based on the intensity and frequency of low-power signals, just like a biological synapse.

The group members tested the ability of the system to both generate reflexes and sense touch.

In one test they hooked up their artificial nerve to a cockroach leg and applied tiny increments of pressure to their touch sensor. The electronic neuron converted the sensor signal into digital signals and relayed them through the synaptic transistor, causing the leg to twitch more or less vigorously as the pressure on the touch sensor increased or decreased.

They also showed that the artificial nerve could detect various touch sensations. In one experiment the artificial nerve was able to differentiate Braille letters. In another, they rolled a cylinder over the sensor in different directions and accurately detected the direction of the motion.

Bao's graduate students Yeongin Kim and Alex Chortos, plus Wentao Xu, a researcher from Lee's lab, were also central to integrating the components into the functional artificial sensory nervous system.

The researchers say artificial nerve technology remains in its infancy. For instance, creating artificial skin coverings for prosthetic devices will require new devices to detect heat and other sensations, the ability to embed them into flexible circuits, and then a way to interface all of this to the brain.

The group also hopes to create low-power, artificial sensor nets to cover robots, the idea being to make them more agile by providing some of the same feedback that humans derive from their skin.

The Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea; Seoul National University (SNU); Samsung Electronics; the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure; and the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF) funded the work. Patents related to this work are planned.

The neuron in turn sends a series of signals to the relevant synapses. The synaptic network recognizes the pattern of the sudden stretch and emits two signals simultaneously, one causing the knee muscles to contract reflexively and a second, less urgent signal to register the sensation in the brain.

Testing the system

The new work has a long way to go before it reaches that level of complexity. But in their paper, the group describes how the electronic neuron delivered signals to the synaptic transistor, which they engineered in such a way that it learned to recognize and react to sensory inputs based on the intensity and frequency of low-power signals, just like a biological synapse.

The group members tested the ability of the system to both generate reflexes and sense touch.

In one test they hooked up their artificial nerve to a cockroach leg and applied tiny increments of pressure to their touch sensor. The electronic neuron converted the sensor signal into digital signals and relayed them through the synaptic transistor, causing the leg to twitch more or less vigorously as the pressure on the touch sensor increased or decreased.

They also showed that the artificial nerve could detect various touch sensations. In one experiment the artificial nerve was able to differentiate Braille letters. In another, they rolled a cylinder over the sensor in different directions and accurately detected the direction of the motion.

Bao's graduate students Yeongin Kim and Alex Chortos, plus Wentao Xu, a researcher from Lee's lab, were also central to integrating the components into the functional artificial sensory nervous system.

The researchers say artificial nerve technology remains in its infancy. For instance, creating artificial skin coverings for prosthetic devices will require new devices to detect heat and other sensations, the ability to embed them into flexible circuits, and then a way to interface all of this to the brain.

The group also hopes to create low-power, artificial sensor nets to cover robots, the idea being to make them more agile by providing some of the same feedback that humans derive from their skin.

The Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea; Seoul National University (SNU); Samsung Electronics; the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure; and the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF) funded the work. Patents related to this work are planned.

But looking at the high court over a period of decades, have political leanings been its strongest barometer?

No, says Eddie Lee, doctoral student in physics, who applied a statistical physics model for magnetic behavior to a ""Super Court"" of 36 Supreme Court justices over seven decades. What Lee found was that consensus dominates the court, and strong correlations in voting far outlast any one justice or court.

Unlike congressional politics, where the winds of change can shift every two years, the court is a behemoth with an ""institutional timescale"" nearly a century long, Lee said.

""Viewing the history of the court through a partisan lens, it doesn't work,"" Lee said. ""Actually, a partisan picture breaks down - in fact, any sort of intuitive picture breaks down. ... The way the Supreme Court fractures over time, and all the different factions you get, you get a huge number of different blocs all competing to appear.""

Lee's paper, ""Partisan Intuition Belies Strong, Institutional Consensus and Wide Zipf's Law for Voting Blocs in U.S. Supreme Court,"" was published Sept. 14 in the Journal of Statistical Physics.

This research builds on a study Lee finished in 2015, ""Statistical Mechanics of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" also published in the Journal of Statistical Physics. He and his collaborator built simple models for the distribution of voting patterns and found that, despite ideological differences, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the modeling of the voting record of the second Rehnquist court (1994-2005, total of 895 votes).

Lee revisited the subject last year and expanded his dataset to include a ""Super Court"" of 36 justices and 24 nine-member courts from 1946 to 2016. Included are seven of the current nine justices; in addition to Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch is not included in the study as his term began in 2017.

The modern Supreme Court is generally accepted as beginning in the mid-1940s; the early courts were dominated by unanimity, Lee said. He noted that previous courts - for example, the one presided over by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the late 1800s - produced 9-0 decisions approximately 90 percent of the time.

While unanimity is nowhere near as prevalent now, it's still the most frequent outcome - ""around 30 to 50 percent"" of the time, Lee said. ""The fact that there's consensus on a single Supreme Court is not surprising, but what I did was try to see how people voted across time,"" he said.

What he found was that, viewing the court as a singular but ever-changing entity, the court defaults to consensus and strong correlations among justices over time. Long stints in which justices overlap can inform how justices vote relative to each other. In other words, if Justice A and Justice B voted together, and Justices B and C voted together, through transitivity one could infer how Justices A and C would have voted together.

""The way I thought of it was, if I lined all these people up from the present back through the past, how many justices back in time would I have to go to get an independent voice, someone who goes against that unanimous vote,"" Lee said. ""You'd have to go pretty far back in time, and what I find is that this time, this correlation length, far exceeds the tenure of any single justice.""

Lee sees it as an institutional timescale that emerges from the collection of justices, one that's not specific to any single justice or any single natural court. ""It's something that spans over time,"" he said, ""as if it were part of the institution itself.""

Yet this tendency to consensus stands in contrast with another result: Consensus occurs amid a backdrop of shifting alliances. Although the Supreme Court is often thought of in terms of voting blocs (e.g., the unanimous voting bloc or the 5-4 partisan voting blocs), Lee finds that no such simple description typifies voting on the Super Court.

Instead, justices on the Super Court are likely to be in a whole variety of unexpected voting blocs. ""No matter what simple picture you prescribe, votes that defy that intuition are probable,"" Lee said.

Despite the left-right divide that defines current political debate, he said, the fact that even ""partisan issues"" are actually much more complicated is reflected in Supreme Court voting over time.

People who learned about neuroscientific research, either by reading a magazine article or through undergraduate coursework, proposed less severe punishment for a hypothetical criminal than did their peers. The findings suggest that they did so because they saw the criminal as less blameworthy.

""There is no academic consensus on free will, but we already do see discussions of brain processes and responsibility trickling through the justice system and other social institutions -- for better or worse,"" says psychological scientist and study author Azim Shariff of the University of Oregon.

While research suggests that most people believe in free will, Shariff and colleagues wondered whether increasing exposure to information about the brain, which suggests a more mechanistic account of human behavior, might have consequences for how we reason about morality and make moral attributions.

They hypothesized that exposing people to information that diminishes belief in free will -- neuroscientific or otherwise -- would, in turn, diminish perceptions of moral responsibility; ultimately, this shift in belief would influence how people think about crime and punishment.

So, for example, if people come to believe that the brain drives behavior, they may be less likely to hold others morally responsible for criminal actions, eliminating the need to punish so that they receive their ""just desserts.""

In an initial experiment, Shariff and colleagues had college students read a passage and then read a fictional scenario about a man who beat another man to death. Some of the students read a passage that rejected free will and advocated a mechanistic view of behavior, while others read a passage unrelated to free will.

Those students who read the passage rejecting free will chose significantly shorter prison sentences, about 5 years, than did those who read the neutral passage, about 10 years.

The effect also emerged when the manipulation was more subtle: Students who read an article about neuroscience findings that only implied mechanistic explanations for human behavior chose shorter prison sentences than did their peers who read about nuclear power or natural headache remedies.

Not only that, they also placed less blame on the transgressor. Further analyses revealed that decreased blameworthiness actually accounted for the relationship between diminished belief in free will and lighter sentences.

Interestingly, students who freely enrolled and participated in an undergraduate course in cognitive neuroscience also showed the effect. Students who took a neuroscience course chose a lighter prison sentence at the end of the semester than they had at the beginning of the semester; this decrease in recommended sentence was associated with self-reported increases in knowledge about the brain over the course of the semester.

Published 10 April 2015

Researchers have created new structures that exploit the electromechanical properties of specific nanofibers to stretch to up to seven times their length, while remaining tougher than Kevlar. These structures absorb up to 98 joules per gram. Kevlar, often used to make bulletproof vests, can absorb up to 80 joules per gram. Researchers hope the structures will one day form material that can reinforce itself at points of high stress and could potentially be used in military airplanes or other defense applications.

Researchers at UT Dallas have created new structures that exploit the electromechanical properties of specific nanofibers to stretch to up to seven times their length, while remaining tougher than Kevlar.

These structures absorb up to 98 joules per gram. Kevlar, often used to make bulletproof vests, can absorb up to 80 joules per gram. Researchers hope the structures will one day form material that can reinforce itself at points of high stress and could potentially be used in military airplanes or other defense applications.

A UT Dallas release reports that in a study published by ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, a journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers twisted nanofiber into yarns and coils. The electricity generated by stretching the twisted nanofiber formed an attraction ten times stronger than a hydrogen bond, which is considered one of the strongest forces formed between molecules.

Researchers sought to mimic their earlier work on the piezoelectric action (how pressure forms electric charges) of collagen fibers found inside bone in hopes of creating high-performance materials that can reinforce itself, said Dr. Majid Minary, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering in the University's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and senior author of the study.

""We reproduced this process in nanofibers by manipulating the creation of electric charges to result in a lightweight, flexible, yet strong material,"" said Minary, who is also a member of the Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute. ""Our country needs such materials on a large scale for industrial and defense applications.""

For their experiment, researchers first spun nanofibers out of a material known as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer, polyvinvylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE).

Researchers then twisted the fibers into yarns, and then continued to twist the material into coils.

""It's literally twisting, the same basic process used in making conventional cable,"" Minary said.

Researchers then measured mechanical properties of the yarn and coils such as how far it can stretch and how much energy it can absorb before failure.

""Our experiment is proof of the concept that our structures can absorb more energy before failure than the materials conventionally used in bulletproof armors,"" Minary said. ""We believe, modeled after the human bone, that this flexibility and strength comes from the electricity that occurs when these nanofibers are twisted.""

The next step in the research is to make larger structures out of the yarns and coils, Minary said.

Researchers have created new structures that exploit the electromechanical properties of specific nanofibers to stretch to up to seven times their length, while remaining tougher than Kevlar. These structures absorb up to 98 joules per gram. Kevlar, often used to make bulletproof vests, can absorb up to 80 joules per gram. Researchers hope the structures will one day form material that can reinforce itself at points of high stress and could potentially be used in military airplanes or other defense applications.

Researchers at UT Dallas have created new structures that exploit the electromechanical properties of specific nanofibers to stretch to up to seven times their length, while remaining tougher than Kevlar.

These structures absorb up to 98 joules per gram. Kevlar, often used to make bulletproof vests, can absorb up to 80 joules per gram. Researchers hope the structures will one day form material that can reinforce itself at points of high stress and could potentially be used in military airplanes or other defense applications.

A UT Dallas release reports that in a study published by ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, a journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers twisted nanofiber into yarns and coils. The electricity generated by stretching the twisted nanofiber formed an attraction ten times stronger than a hydrogen bond, which is considered one of the strongest forces formed between molecules.

Researchers sought to mimic their earlier work on the piezoelectric action (how pressure forms electric charges) of collagen fibers found inside bone in hopes of creating high-performance materials that can reinforce itself, said Dr. Majid Minary, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering in the University's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and senior author of the study.

""We reproduced this process in nanofibers by manipulating the creation of electric charges to result in a lightweight, flexible, yet strong material,"" said Minary, who is also a member of the Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute. ""Our country needs such materials on a large scale for industrial and defense applications.""

For their experiment, researchers first spun nanofibers out of a material known as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer, polyvinvylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE).

Researchers then twisted the fibers into yarns, and then continued to twist the material into coils.

""It's literally twisting, the same basic process used in making conventional cable,"" Minary said.

Researchers then measured mechanical properties of the yarn and coils such as how far it can stretch and how much energy it can absorb before failure.

""Our experiment is proof of the concept that our structures can absorb more energy before failure than the materials conventionally used in bulletproof armors,"" Minary said. ""We believe, modeled after the human bone, that this flexibility and strength comes from the electricity that occurs when these nanofibers are twisted.""

The next step in the research is to make larger structures out of the yarns and coils, Minary said.

Studies of dog genomes needn't devolve into shaggy dog stories, not if scientists look at the right genomes. Specifically, scientists should consider the advantages of analyzing the genomes of village dogs instead of breed dogs. According to scientists based at the University of Michigan, a comparison of village dog and wolf genomes may emphasize the genetic changes associated with humans' first efforts to domesticate dogs, while deemphasizing the genetic changes associated with later efforts at dog breeding.

Just this sort of comparison was carried out by a team of scientists led by Jeffrey Kidd, Ph.D., an assistant professor of human genetics. In Dr. Kidd's lab, postdoctoral research fellow Amanda Pendleton, Ph.D., had been reviewing current domestication research when she noticed something peculiar about the DNA of modern dogs--at some places, it didn't appear to match DNA from ancient dogs.

""We convinced ourselves that previous studies found many genes not associated with being a dog but with being a breed dog,"" said Pendleton. Breed dogs, which mostly arose around 300 years ago, are not fully reflective of the genetic diversity in dogs around the world, she explains. Three-quarters of the world's dogs are so-called village dogs, who roam, scavenge for food near human populations, and are able to mate freely. To get a fuller picture of the genetic changes at play in dog evolution, the team looked at 43 village dogs from places such as India, Portugal, and Vietnam.

Armed with DNA from village dogs, ancient dogs found at burial sites from around 5000 years ago, and wolves, they used statistical methods to tease out genetic changes that resulted from humans' first efforts at domestication from those associated with the development of specific breeds. This new genetic review revealed 246 candidate domestication sites, most of them identified for the first time by their lab.

Additional details appeared June 28 in the journal BMC Biology, in an article entitled ""Comparison of Village Dog and Wolf Genomes Highlights the Role of the Neural Crest in Dog Domestication."" As the title of this article indicates, the comparison highlighted genes linked to neural crest and central nervous system development as well as neurological function.

""Our results identify genes that act early in embryogenesis and can confer phenotypes distinguishing domesticated dogs from wolves, such as tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development as the targets of selection during domestication,"" the article's authors wrote. ""These differences reflect the phenotypes of the domestication syndrome, which can be explained by alterations in the migration or activity of neural crest cells during development.""

One gene in particular stuck out, called RAI1, which was the study's highest ranked gene. In a different lab within the department of human genetics, Michigan Medicine assistant professor of human genetics Shigeki Iwase, Ph.D., has been studying this gene's function and role in neurodevelopmental disorders. He notes that in humans, changes to the RAI1 gene result in one of two syndromes--Smith-Magenis syndrome if RAI1 is missing, or Potocki-Lupski syndrome if RAI1 is duplicated.

""RAI1 is a good entry point into studying brain function because its mutation results in a brain disorder,"" he noted. ""Studies suggest that this protein controls the expression of several genes involved in circadian rhythms. One of the unique features in these conditions is the problem these patients have with sleep.""

In dogs, changes to this gene may help explain why domesticated dogs are awake during the day rather than nocturnal like most wolves. Other genes Kidd's lab identified in dogs have overlap with human syndromes resulting from improper development of neural crest cells, including facial deformities and hypersociability. These parallels between dogs and humans are what make understanding dog genetics valuable.

Kidd explains, ""We are using these changes that were selected for by humans for thousands of years as a way to understand the natural function and gene regulatory environment of the neural crest in all vertebrates.""

A blood test revealed that he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious. Doctors swiftly isolated him.

The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. Over five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, swept through a hospital in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit, and taken root in India, Pakistan and South Africa.

Recently C. auris reached New York, New Jersey and Illinois, leading the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add it to a list of germs deemed ""urgent threats.""

The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but C. auris did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it.

""Everything was positive -- the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,"" said Dr. Scott Lorin, the hospital's president. ""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.""

C. auris is so tenacious, in part, because it is impervious to major antifungal medications, making it a new example of one of the world's most intractable health threats: the rise of drug-resistant infections.

For decades, public health experts have warned about the overuse of antibiotics. But lately, there has been an explosion of resistant fungi as well.

""It's an enormous problem,"" said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London. ""We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.""

Simply put, fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines.

The strong survive

Yet even as health leaders have pleaded for more restraint in prescribing antimicrobial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi -- convening the U.N. General Assembly in 2016 to manage an emerging crisis -- gluttonous overuse of them in hospitals, clinics and farming has continued.

Resistant germs are often called ""superbugs,"" but this is simplistic because they don't typically kill everyone. Instead, they are most lethal to people with immature or compromised immune systems, including newborns and the elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders.

Antibiotics and antifungals are both essential to combat infections in people, but antibiotics are also used widely to prevent disease in farm animals, and antifungals are also applied to prevent agricultural plants from rotting. Some scientists cite evidence that rampant use of fungicides on crops is contributing to the surge in drug-resistant fungi.

Yet as the problem grows, it is little understood by the public -- in part because the very existence of resistant infections is often cloaked in secrecy.

With bacteria and fungi alike, hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as infection hubs. Even the CDC, under its agreement with states, is not allowed to make public the location or name of hospitals involved in outbreaks. State governments have declined to publicly share information.

All the while, the germs are easily spread -- carried on hands and equipment inside hospitals; ferried on meat and manure-fertilized vegetables from farms; transported across borders by travelers and goods; and transferred by patients from nursing home to hospital and back.

C. auris, which infected the man at Mount Sinai, is one of dozens of dangerous bacteria and fungi virtually unknown to the public.

Nearly half of patients who contract C. auris die within 90 days, according to the CDC. Yet the world's experts have not nailed down where it came from in the first place.

""It is a creature from the black lagoon,"" said Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads the fungal branch at the CDC, which is spearheading a global effort to find treatments and stop the spread. ""It bubbled up and now it is everywhere.""

'No need' to tell

In late 2015, Dr. Johanna Rhodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital, a British medical center outside London. C. auris had taken root there months earlier, and the hospital couldn't clear it.

""'We have no idea where it's coming from. We've never heard of it. It's just spread like wildfire,'"" Rhodes said she was told.

Under her direction, hospital workers used a special device to spray aerosolized hydrogen peroxide around a room used for a patient with C. auris, the theory being that the vapor would scour each nook and cranny. They left the device going for a week. Then they put a ""settle plate"" in the middle of the room with a gel at the bottom that would serve as a place for any surviving microbes to grow, Rhodes said.

Only one organism grew back. C. auris.

It was spreading, but word of it was not. The hospital, a lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement.

""There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak,"" said Oliver Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.

This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world. Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients -- or prospective ones.

By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper reported ""an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases"" at Royal Brompton, and the hospital took an extraordinary step: It shut down its ICU for 11 days, moving intensive care patients to another floor, again with no announcement.

Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem.

The secrecy infuriates patient advocates, who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak so they can decide whether to go to a hospital, particularly when dealing with a nonurgent matter, like elective surgery.

""Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year and a half later -- and not have it front-page news the day after it happens?"" said Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, a physician in Kentucky and board chairman of Health Watch USA, a nonprofit patient advocacy group. ""You wouldn't tolerate this at a restaurant with a food poisoning outbreak.""

On June 24, 2016, the CDC blasted a nationwide warning to hospitals and medical groups and set up an email address, candidaauris@cdc.gov, to field queries. Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a key member of the fungal team, expected to get a trickle -- ""maybe a message every month.""

Instead, within weeks, her inbox exploded.

In the United States, 587 cases of people having contracted C. auris have been reported, concentrated with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois, according to the CDC.

The symptoms -- fever, aches and fatigue -- are seemingly ordinary, but when a person gets infected, particularly someone already unhealthy, such commonplace symptoms can be fatal.

Dr. Matthew McCarthy, who has treated several C. auris patients at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, described experiencing an unusual fear when treating a 30-year-old man.

""I found myself not wanting to touch the guy,"" he said. ""I didn't want to take it from the guy and bring it to someone else."" He did his job and thoroughly examined the patient, but said, ""There was an overwhelming feeling of being terrified of accidentally picking it up on a sock or tie or gown.""",5,0.2,0,0.0,DEADLY SECRECY: Hospitals and nursing homes quietly battle a hardy fungus - Entertainment & Life - Sarasota Herald-Tribune,"In May, an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery.

Too often, it's only after a transplanted organ has sustained serious damage that a biopsy reveals the organ is in rejection. A new screening method using sensor particles and a urine test could catch rejection much earlier, more comprehensively, and without a biopsy needle.

When the body's immune system has just begun attacking cells of a transplanted organ, the new method's particles send a fluorescent signal into the urine. In a new study, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University validated the method in a mouse model, and they have engineered the sensor with highly biocompatible components, which could make the path to potential future trials easier.

A patient may feel fine, and a biopsy may look deceptively clean when T cells have already begun attacking a transplanted organ. The sensor particle, a nanoparticle, detects a T cell weapon, an enzyme called granzyme B, that pushes a transplanted organ's cells into the self-destruction process called apoptosis.

Earliest detection

""Before any organ damage can happen, T cells have to produce granzyme B, which is why this is an early detection method,"" said Gabe Kwong, a co-principal investigator in the study and an assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University.

""This is sensitive enough to possibly detect budding rejection before you see significant injury to the transplanted organ and that could help clinicians treat early to prevent damage,"" said Dr. Andrew Adams, co-principal investigator and an associate professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine. ""Right now, most tests are aimed at organ dysfunction, and sometimes they don't signal there is a problem until organ function is below 50 percent.""

Kwong and Adams published the study's results in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering on February 18, 2019. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

Bristly nanoball

The nanoparticles are put together with iron oxide in the middle like a ball. It is double-coated with dextran, a sugar, and polyethylene glycol, a common ingredient in laxatives, to keep the body from disposing of it too quickly.

Bristles made of amino acids stick out from the iron ball with fluorescent ""reporter"" molecules attached to their tips.

The particles are injected intravenously. They are too big to accumulate in native tissue or to pass through the kidneys and out of the body but small enough to accumulate in the tissue of struggling transplanted organs, where they keep a lookout for rejection.

Exploiting rejection

Once T cells start secreting granzyme B, it severs amino acid strands in the transplanted organ's cells, triggering the cells to unravel and die.

""The nanoparticles' bristles mimic granzyme's amino acid targets in the cells, so the enzyme cuts the bristles on the nanoparticle at the same time,"" said Kwong who directs the Laboratory for Synthetic Immunity in the Coulter Department. ""That releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine.""

In the experiment, the animals' urine glowed and could be seen in their bladders in near-infrared images.

Comprehensive method

The researchers plan to augment their new sensor to detect the other major cause of transplant rejection, attacks by antibodies, which are not living cells but proteins the body creates to neutralize foreign entities.

""Antibodies kill their target cells through similar types of enzymes. In the future, we envision a single sensor to detect both types of rejection,"" Kwong said. But there is even more potential.

""This method could be adapted to tease out multiple problems like rejection, infection or injury to the transplanted organ,"" Adams said. ""The treatments for all of those are different, so we could select the proper treatment or combination of treatments and also use the test to measure how effective treatment is.""

Outdoing biopsies

Biopsies are currently the gold standard in detection but they can go wrong, and the wide, long needle can damage tissue.

""The biggest risk of a biopsy is bleeding and injury to the transplanted organ,"" Adams said. ""Then there's the possibility of infection. You're also just taking a tiny fraction of the transplanted organ to determine what's going on with the whole organ, and you may miss rejection or misdiagnose it because the needle didn't hit the right spot.""

The urine test gets a more global reading on the whole organ, and it has other advantages over biopsies.

""The biopsy is not predictive. It's a static snapshot. It's like looking at a photo of people in mid-jump. You don't know if they're on their way up or on their way down. With a biopsy, you don't know whether rejection is progressing or regressing,"" Kwong said.

""Our method measures biological activity rates, and that tells us where things are going.""

Immunosuppressant medications

That could also allow clinicians to carefully dose powerful immunosuppressant medications that the vast majority of transplant patients receive.

""Adjusting the dose is very difficult but very important because heavy immunosuppression increases occurrence of infections and patients who receive it also get cancer more often,"" Kwong said.

For this experiment, the researchers used small skin grafts on mice and got a very clear, timely signal from the nanoparticle sensor. Since organ transplants represent a lot more tissue, the researchers believe that any occurrence of organ rejection would trigger a much larger signal from the sensor.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. - No patient who just got out of the hospital wants to end up there again soon. Whoever's paying their hospital bills doesn't want that either.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. - No patient who just got out of the hospital wants to end up there again soon. Whoever's paying their hospital bills doesn't want that either.

That's why the Medicare system has started penalizing hospitals with the highest readmission rates for certain conditions. But a new study suggests that unlike hospital gowns, such penalties should not be one-size-fits-all.

In fact, the study shows, certain social, economic, disability and personal-care factors can make a major difference in the readmission risk of people who were recently hospitalized for heart failure, pneumonia or a heart attack.

And the factors that make the most difference vary greatly from condition to condition, and are largely not something a hospital can change through treatment.

For instance, pneumonia patients who already had trouble with multiple tasks like getting dressed or cooking food, or who needed paid help at home, before their hospital stay were the most likely of all pneumonia patients to be readmitted in the first 30 days after a hospitalization, the study shows.

But for patients with heart failure, that kind of functional difficulty didn't matter as much as money, family and race. Those who had a higher wealth level or adult children had a much lower chance of readmission -- while simply being African American increased the risk of another hospital stay.

And for heart attack survivors, the most important factors boosting their chance of readmission were whether they had been in a nursing home before their hospital stay, and whether their hospital cared for a high percentage of minority patients.

The results, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, come from a team from the University of Michigan Medical School and Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, and the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System. They used data from the Health and Retirement Study, based at the U-M Institute for Social Research, and from Medicare, and looked at 10 measures of disability and what are called ""social determinants of health"".

A model to inform change

The resulting model of readmission risk they developed could be used to predict a patient's chances of readmission, and prompt hospitals to offer extra support such as transportation and home visits. At the same time, it could give the agency that runs Medicare a new tool for determining which hospitals truly have high readmission rates given the patients they treat.

Currently, Medicare adjusts its penalties based only on how sick a hospital's patients are; the more severely ill, the lower the penalty. The research team started with the existing Medicare adjustments and then added the patient's social determinants of health to assess their incremental value.

But the new study looks at factors that the hospital can't control, such as patients' race, education, income, social and family support, difficulty taking care of themselves, and what environment they return to after a hospital stay.

Such factors have emerged in other research as crucial to a patient's overall chance of a good outcome. But they've never been studied for how their impact upon readmission risk may vary among people with the same reason for their initial hospitalization.

""The relationship between socioeconomic status, functional status and use of health care is not a simple or straightforward as people might think,"" says Jennifer Meddings, M.D., M.Sc., first author of the new paper and an assistant professor of internal medicine at U-M. ""The impact is different depending on condition. We hope these findings will inform future adjustments in the models for readmission.""

Penalize or reward?

Meddings notes that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare and pays for the care of tens of millions of seniors and seriously disabled people, has opened the door for socioeconomic status to be considered in its programs. The National Academy of Sciences has convened a committee to evaluate evidence on the topic, and present it to CMS.

""In many ways, hospitals these days are being held accountable for the failures of the social safety net, as policies have been developed and implemented to evaluate the performance of hospitals and tie payment to that,"" says Meddings. ""As these programs are refined, understanding the impact of social determinants of health will be crucial.""

Accounting for the social determinants of health that could be helping or hurting a hospital's specific patient population could go two ways, she notes. Factoring these issues in to reduce or increase penalties is one way. But another would be to provide additional payment for the services that hospitals don't typically get paid for, such as hiring social workers to connect patients with social services and resources that can help them avoid another hospital stay.

Patients who are ""dual eligible"" - old or disabled enough for Medicare, and poor enough for Medicaid - present a special challenge. The new study looked at Medicaid status but the sample size wasn't large enough to determine if it played a role in readmission risk.

Meddings sees hope for using social determinants of health and disability level in health care payment, based on the fact that many of these measures are now captured in electronic medical records when a person arrives at a hospital or when they're being prepared to leave. CMS has traditionally used Medicare claims data - how much the hospital billed the system - but mining EHR data could prove fruitful if it can be done in a standard way, Meddings says.

But, she notes, just knowing that a patient has a spouse or adult children doesn't show how helpful those family members will be to the patient.

Meddings and her colleagues have started studying this same issue in Medicare patients who have had a joint replacement, since CMS has begun penalizing hospitals for high readmissions after a hip or knee replacement operation.

In a paper publishe",0.29411764705882354,1,"A team of scientists argues that we should evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas based on the outcomes for biodiversity, not simple the area of land or ocean they protect.

In a paper published April 11 in the journal Science, they outline the weaknesses of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, which set goals of protecting 17 percent of the earth's surface and 10 percent of its oceans by 2020.

They propose monitoring the outcomes of protected areas that measure changes in biodiversity in comparison to agreed-upon ""reference"" levels and then using those figures to determine how well they are performing.

Countries should concentrate on outcomes instead of actions when they set aside areas for parks and reserves to shore up the loss of biodiversity, according to a group of scientists.

At the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity conference in Aichi, Japan, in 2010, more than 190 countries committed to protecting 17 percent of the Earth's land and 10 percent of the oceans by 2020, along with 19 other goals aimed at stemming the worldwide loss of biodiversity.

But the researchers say that Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, the current guide for increasing the proportion of the planet that's protected, is too focused on percentage targets. That leads to conservation of less critical areas and other ""perverse outcomes,"" said Piero Visconti, the paper's lead author and an ecologist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna.

""Everyone is celebrating the fact that we've nearly got 17 percent of land formally protected,"" Visconti said. ""Except biodiversity keeps going down both inside and outside protected areas.""

Visconti and his colleagues published their paper April 11 in the journal Science.

The team acknowledges that the goals set forth in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets likely spurred increases in the area of land and sea protected since 2010. But Aichi Target 11 has led countries to focus on hitting those numbers, not creating protected areas, or PAs, that will best protect threatened species, they write.

""Having a percentage target is easy because people can visualize it, and it's easy to report and monitor,"" Visconti said.

In some cases, the result was ""many new PAs being established in locations that are disproportionately unimportant for biodiversity,"" the authors say. A 2014 study suggests that placing parks and reserves in places where threatened and underrepresented species live would include 30 times more plant and animals species threatened with extinction within the borders of delineated protected areas.

Elsewhere, some parks and reserves are protected in name only, without adequate resources, for example, to keep out poachers or halt the creeping conversion of habitat to farmland. And yet, each hectare in these ""paper parks"" counts just as much toward meeting percentage targets as a hectare in a reserve where authorities have invested in the people and tools required to protect biodiversity. Even in the latter case, however, the effectiveness of parks is measured in the inputs, rather than the protected area's impact on biodiversity.

In the last six decades, designated protected areas have done a better job of protecting local and global cross-sections of animal and plant communities called ""ecoregions."" But the authors contend that such a broad view doesn't necessarily protect comparable levels of species diversity, according to recent research. Focusing targets on these finer details will better encourage the survival of not just species themselves, but of genetic variation and the ecological functions that diverse networks of life are responsible for, they write.

Finally, sorting out who is responsible for what parts of meeting an international goal like Aichi Target 11 has proven challenging, and as a result, national protected area commitments have fallen short of the requirements laid out in the target.

""We need all nations to be honest when accounting for how much land and water they have set aside for biodiversity conservation,"" James Watson, an ecologist at the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement.

For the targets to protect biodiversity, they must be scalable, the authors say -- that is, the national share of responsibility toward the target needs to be measurable, and the sum of all national responsibilities should achieve the global target.

To address these issues, they propose monitoring the outcomes of protected areas that measure changes in biodiversity in comparison to agreed-upon ""reference"" levels and then using those figures to determine how well they are performing.

In addition, the researchers argue that the most important sites should be prioritized for protection based on a universal standard. In 2016, the IUCN published guidelines for defining these ""key biodiversity areas"" that take into account variables such as how irreplaceable the threatened species in a certain area are and whether they exist in other parts of the world.

""We know protected areas work,"" Watson said. ""[W]hen well-funded, well-managed and well placed, they are extremely effective in halting the threats that cause biodiversity loss and [ensuring] species return from the brink of extinction.

""The challenge is to improve the management of those protected areas that are most valuable for nature conservation to ensure they safeguard it,"" he added.

The conservation community is now considering the next steps in protecting biodiversity after 2020. Focusing efforts toward these targets based on outcomes that are positive for biodiversity, rather than the protection of a certain area of land or ocean, is what will truly make a difference in reversing the disappearance of species, Visconti said.

""If governments are serious about protecting biodiversity, there's no other way,"" he said.

In a sort of paradox fashion, research published in the journal Science found that increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere cause soil microbes to produce more carbon dioxide, accelerating climate change.

These findings challenge scientists' previous notion that increased CO 2 levels accelerate plant growth, which causes more absorption of CO 2 via photosynthesis.

Until now, it was believed that carbon is stored in wood and soil for a long time, stalling climate change for a time. But two Northern Arizona University (NAU) researchers, who led the study, revealed that the extra carbon provides fuel to microorganisms in the soil whose byproducts (such as CO 2 ) are released into the atmosphere, in fact contributing to climate change.

""Our findings mean that nature is not as efficient in slowing global warming as we previously thought,"" Kees Jan van Groenigen, research fellow at the Center for Ecosystem Science and Society at NAU, said in a press release.

""By overlooking this effect of increased CO 2 on soil microbes, models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may have overestimated the potential of soil to store carbon and mitigate the greenhouse effect.""

To reach their conclusion, and to better understand how soil microbes respond to Earth's changing atmosphere, researchers analyzed results from 53 different experiments in forests, grasslands and agricultural fields around the world. These combined studies measured how excess atmospheric CO 2 affects plant growth, microbial production of carbon dioxide, and the total amount of soil carbon at the end of each experiment.

""We've long thought soils to be a stable, safe place to store carbon, but our results show soil carbon is not as stable as we previously thought,"" co-author Bruce Hungate added.

May 29 (UPI) -- After studying data from two interplanetary probes, researchers think Pluto may have formed from a mass of a billion comets, according to a new study.

Scientists at the Southwest Research Institute investigated two theories about the formation of what was previously known as the farthest-out planet in the solar system -- the comet theory, and a solar theory that the dwarf planet formed from very cold ices similar to those of the Sun -- using data from NASA's New Horizons probe and the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe.

The researchers integrated data from two of the probe's missions, one to Pluto and one to a comet called 67P, focusing on the amount of nitrogen and carbon dioxide now present at the dwarf planet, leaving them with the two theories.

""This research builds upon the fantastic successes of the New Horizons and Rosetta missions to expand our understanding of the origin and evolution of Pluto,"" Dr. Christopher Glein, a researcher at SwRI's Space Science and Engineering Division, said in a press release. ""Using chemistry as a detective's tool, we are able to trace certain features we see on Pluto today to formation processes from long ago. This leads to a new appreciation of the richness of Pluto's 'life story,' which we are only starting to grasp.""

RELATED Kuiper Belt tilt suggests a mysterious planetary mass lurks in the outer solar system

To determine the amount of nitrogen present on Pluto now, and lost over time, the researchers worked to calculate how much carbon monoxide is there as well, and how much has been lost over time.

For the study, published recently in the journal Icarus, the researchers focused on the glacier Sputnik Planitia, which is located in the left lobe of the Tombaugh Regio, a heart-shaped region of Pluto's surface.

Based on the nitrogen on the dwarf planet, and low level of carbon monoxide detected there, researchers say carbon monoxide on Pluto is either trapped in ice on its surface or it was destroyed by exposure to liquid water.

""We've developed what we call 'the giant comet' cosmochemical model of Pluto formation,"" Glein said. ""We found an intriguing consistency between the estimated amount of nitrogen inside the glacier and the amount that would be expected if Pluto was formed by the agglomeration of roughly a billion comets or other Kuiper Belt objects similar in chemical composition to 67P, the comet explored by Rosetta.""

""Using chemistry as a detective's tool, we are able to trace certain features we see on Pluto today to formation processes from long ago. This leads to a new appreciation of the richness of Pluto's 'life story,' which we are only starting to grasp.""<br><br>RELATED Kuiper Belt tilt suggests a mysterious planetary mass lurks in the outer solar system<br><br>To determine the amount of nitrogen present on Pluto now, and lost over time, the researchers worked to calculate how much carbon monoxide is there as well, and how much has been lost over time.<br><br>For the study, published recently in the journal Icarus, the researchers focused on the glacier Sputnik Planitia, which is located in the left lobe of the Tombaugh Regio, a heart-shaped region of Pluto's surface.<br><br>Based on the nitrogen on the dwarf planet, and low level of carbon monoxide detected there, researchers say carbon monoxide on Pluto is either trapped in ice on its surface or it was destroyed by exposure to liquid water.<br><br>""We've developed what we call 'the giant comet' cosmochemical model of Pluto formation,"" Glein said. ""We found an intriguing consistency between the estimated amount of nitrogen inside the glacier and the amount that would be expected if Pluto was formed by the agglomeration of roughly a billion comets or other Kuiper Belt objects similar in chemical composition to 67P, the comet explored by Rosetta.""<br><br>Glein said the new research suggests the initial chemical makeup of Pluto was modified by water, but that overall more work will be needed to solidify a theory. </div>"

About 6,000 women were asked about their birthing experiences as part of the research led by Queensland University of Technology Associate Professor Yvette Miller, who partnered with the Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to survey women over the course of a four-month timeframe. The results of the study were published on BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.

Participants reported on what are considered to be the four aspects of a ""normal"" birth experience, which include ""onset of labor, use of anaesthetics, mode of birth, and use of episiotomy."" A ""normal"" birth, as stated in the study, was defined as an unassisted vaginal delivery without the need for induction of labor, epidural, general anesthetic, forceps to assist in the birth, or episiotomy.

Miller explained the purpose of the research survey.

""We do this kind of research primarily to give women the information they need to make informed decisions about their maternity care.""

Many women, Miller said, are simply not aware their choice regarding maternal care will directly influence both their labor and birth experiences. According to Miller, the choice of maternity care provider, along with a mother's choice of birth facility, positioning during labor and while the boy is being born, and how the baby is monitored while the mother is in labor, are all factors.

Of the 6,000 women who participated in the research survey, only 28.7 percent experienced a ""normal"" birth. Miller went on to explain the maternal care choices that influence the overall outcome of a mother's birthing experience.

Miller explained that women have a birthing experience free of medical interventions if they live outside of a major city, are able to freely move throughout their labor, and were able to receive continuity of care in both their labor and birthing experiences.

""In addition, the UIP pattern in RA-ILD is associated with significantly shortened survival compared with that in those without the UIP pattern.""Chest CT has been previously proven to aid in accurate prediction of histopathologic UIP pattern in some patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Assayag and colleagues designed their study to determine the accuracy of CT in identifying the histopathologic UIP pattern in patients with RA-ILD.CT images from 69 patients with RA and biopsy-proven ILD were analyzed in the study and independently reviewed by two thoracic radiologists. Using published criteria, the radiologists categorized CT patterns as definite UIP, possible UIP, or inconsistent with UIP. Biopsy results were reviewed by an experienced lung pathologist. Lastly, the sensitivity and specificity of definite CT UIP pattern to histopathologic UIP pattern were established.Results indicated that histopathologic UIP pattern was found in 61 percent of the patients. Male sex was the only clinical variable associated with histopathologic UIP pattern. Twenty patients had a definite UIP pattern on CT scans. The specificity of CT UIP pattern was 96 percent with a negative predictive value of 53 percent, while the sensitivity was 45 percent with a positive predictive value of 95 percent.

Thanks for any insights :-DWil@Ask D'Mine answers: Actually, the times are a changin' on this front. More on that in a sec. The original reason for the advice, which, granted, was worded much more like a restriction, was more pragmatic than medically necessary. Basically, there are two practical reasons not to re-refrigerate the insulin pens you're using: Cold insulin stings when you inject it, and bubbles tend to form inside pens when they are stuck back in the fridge.That's one side of the coin.The other side of the coin is that once the insulin cartridge in the pen is breached by a needle--first touched by the outside environment--the clock is ticking on how long the insulin lasts, and keeping it cold doesn't slow the count down, so there's no benefit in putting it back in the fridge.But there's no real harm either. And in fact, Novo is in mid-process of changing this recommendation. While it remains on the older prescribing info (PI) sheets, as with Levemir, it has already disappeared from Tresiba's PI. For more on this subject, the folks at MedAngel have a nice little article on the history of this recommendation (and the history of confusion around it!). Abraham, type 3 from New Jersey, writes: My wife has diabetes, and had a stroke that impaired her speech, and her legs are swollen. Please, what can be done that will bring a quick solution to this challenge?Wil@Ask D'Mine answers: Damn. That sucks. I'm so sorry to hear that this happened to her. Strokes are truly wicked, and, sadly, there's no quick solution. It will take time, perhaps a lot of time, and it will be baby steps all the way. The only encouragement I can give is to tell you that she's crossed the first hurdle: Surviving. Apparently, about a third of strokes are fatal in the first place. For survivors, there are a lot of factors in play, as no two strokes are alike, but generally initial rehab lasts 5-6 weeks. Going forward, whatever improvement in movement you're going to see will happen within the first half year, but continued recovery--especially in the area of speech--is still possible for two years.As for the swollen legs, just make sure that all her docs know that what she's suffering is something new as many older people with diabetes suffer swollen legs. That said, it's apparently a common post-stroke occurrence, although typically only on the stroke side of the body, and it's one of the things that can be improved with physical therapy.Last thing: This is hard on her, but perhaps doubly hard on you as her caregiver. Be sure to get as much help as you can from family and friends, and join a stroke survivor caregiver support group near you.  Deb, type 2 from New York, asks: How effective are the FreeStyle Lite strips if they expired two years ago?Wil@Ask D'Mine answers: Probably close to zero, and they'll be least accurate in the zones where you need the most accuracy: High readings and low readings. While test strips appear to be electronic devices, they actually use enzymes, which are biological substances that can, like all biological things, die in time--which is why strips have an expiration date. Can you push the date a bit? Sure. But not that far. If they are more than two months past their expiration date, pitch them into the trash. Antoinette, pre-diabetic from Georgia, asks: Will I keep having constant yeast and bacterial infection and odor because of my use of meth while being pre-diabetic?Wil@Ask D'Mine answers: Uhhh.... OK. You got me on that one. While yeast infections are a common annoyance for female PWDs with poor blood sugar control, they're not that common for women with prediabetes. And even with women who have full-blown out-of-control diabetes, a ""constant"" yeast infection would be rare. So something else is going on with you. Could it be the meth? It might. Although not well studied, there's at least some evidence that meth has a negative impact on the immune system, so that could theoretically result in super-frequent yeast infections. This is a tough prescription to take, but getting yourself clean will help. The body has an amazing ability to bounce back. But you also mentioned bacterial infections. It would seem that your immune system is out of whack. Not to scare the heck out of you, but have you been tested for HIV/AIDs?For some pretty complex reasons, meth can turn your body into an AIDs incubator and accelerator, if exposed. And in my research on your question I discovered that the perfect recipe for really frequent yeast infections is HIV + a low white blood cell count (CD4) and apparently these HIV/low CD4 yeast infections don't respond well to typical over the counter remedies, although there are nuclear options from the prescription pad that can knock them out. But before you can get those, you'll need to know if you have HIV.So please get yourself tested. Right away.

A California study published in the British Medical Journal found the cost of baby births in hospitals can differ by tens of thousands of dollars, and the variation is largely unexplained by market forces.

Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco studied data for privately insured patients who were admitted to California hospitals in 2011 for uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (76,766 cases) or uncomplicated caesarean sections (32,660 cases).

After adjusting for patient demographic and clinical characteristics, they found the average California woman could be charged as little as $3,296 or as much as $37,227 for a vaginal delivery, and $8,312 to $70,908 for a caesarean section -- depending on the hospital to which she was admitted.

""We found that hospitals in markets with middling competition had significantly lower adjusted charges for vaginal deliveries, while hospitals with higher wage indices and case mixes, as well as for-profit hospitals, had higher adjusted charges,"" the authors wrote. They also found hospitals in markets with higher rates of uninsured patients charged significantly less for caesarean sections, while for-profit hospitals and hospitals with higher wage indices charged more.

Despite these correlations, the researchers found institutional and market-level factors included in their models explained only up to 36 percent of the variation in charges between hospitals.

""These results indicate that charges and discounted prices for two common, relatively homogeneous diagnosis groups -- uncomplicated vaginal delivery and caesarean section -- vary widely between hospitals and are not well explained by observable patient or hospital characteristics,"" the study authors concluded.

Date:5/12/2015

The Rosewood Centers for Eating Disorders(r), the nationas leader in treating anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorders and obesity, announces the recent hires of Amelia Davis, M.D., and Nicole Garber, M.D., to lead its highly regarded eating disorders programs. By joining Program Director Dena Cabrera, Psy.D., long-time Rosewood clinician, author and expert in the field of eating disorders prevention and treatment, the trio comprise a adream teama bringing the most advanced, neuroscience-driven care to patients suffering from anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, obesity and other eating disorders conditions. This esteemed group leads Rosewoodas multidisciplinary treatment team which evaluates and coordinates individualized treatment for each patient.

aUnfortunately, the diagnosis and management of Eating Disorders is often not taught in many psychiatric residency programs. This has resulted in a lack of well trained, experienced clinicians. Programs which are able to recruit an expert in the field, such as Dr. Davis, have a distinct competitive advantage over other treatment facilities that will result in improved clinical outcomes. The Rosewood Centers are fortunate to have recruited such an outstanding, young academic and clinical expert as their new Medical Director and Chief of Adult Eating Disorders Services. Dr. Amelia Davis brings her years of experience and expertise gained as Medical Director and Chief of Eating Disorders at the University of Florida to her new post. The patients and staff of Rosewood will benefit greatly from her leadership and clinical skills,a notes David Baron M.S.Ed., D.O., Professor and Vice Chairman, Department of Psychiatry, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.

Amelia Davis, M.D., has been named Medical Director and Chief, Adult Psychiatry and Inpatient Eating Disorders Unit. Dr. Davis is a highly regarded expert and educator specializing in evaluation and treatment of adults with anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders. She leaves a full-time academic career at the University of Florida to become the Medical Director and Chief Medical Officer at Rosewood Centers for Eating Disorders(r) center of excellence. One of her recent UF colleagues, nationally recognized expert, Dr. Nicole Avena, PhD, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, also a researcher, academic and eating disorder expert says, ""Dr. Davis brought great passion and compassion to the Disordered Eating programs, not only by evaluating and treating University and other patients but also in in education and prevention. She will be a great asset to Rosewood. She brings with her a track record of success in eating disorders research and treatment, and I am confident this will continue in her new role as Medical Director.a

Dr. Davis developed an early passion for eating disorders patients. She was mentored and trained as a psychiatry resident by UFas Eating Disorder Recovery Center (EDRC) founder Kevin Wandler, M.D. who is 2015 President of iAEDP (International Association of Eating Disorders Professionals Foundation). During Dr. Davisas work with Dr. Wandler, UF's programs expanded from inpatient hospital- based to outpatient and became a comprehensive community-based eating disorders recovery center. Dr. Davisas leadership allowed the Eating Disorders inpatient unit to become recognized as a center of excellence for the evaluation and treatment of Eating Disordered patients with significant medical and psychiatric co-occurring illnesses. She followed many of them across the levels of care back to the University or home. For more information on Dr. Amelia Davis, visit ameliadavismd.com.

Nicole Garber, M.D., has been named Chief of Pediatric and Adolescent Eating Disorders at Rosewood Centers for Eating Disorders(r). Dr. Nicole Garber is one of the few pediatric and adolescent eating disorders experts who is dual board-certified in General Psychiatry and in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Dr. Garber brings a wealth of experience as a staff psychiatrist for young adults ages 18 to 30 who have struggled with launching into adulthood.

Most recently, Dr. Garber treated adolescents at the prestigious Menninger Clinic while also serving as Assistant Professor of Psychiatry with Baylor University College of Medicine, located in Texas. She led the Menninger Clinicas inpatient treatment team as well as providing individual therapy for patients on other units. Dr. Garber also led therapeutic body image groups along with DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) groups. Prior, she worked with clients in the Juvenile Justice Unit at the Harris County Psychiatric Center while on faculty as Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Houston.

This esteemed group leads Rosewoodas multidisciplinary treatment team which evaluates and coordinates individualized treatment for each patient.

aUnfortunately, the diagnosis and management of Eating Disorders is often not taught in many psychiatric residency programs. This has resulted in a lack of well trained, experienced clinicians. Programs which are able to recruit an expert in the field, such as Dr. Davis, have a distinct competitive advantage over other treatment facilities that will result in improved clinical outcomes. The Rosewood Centers are fortunate to have recruited such an outstanding, young academic and clinical expert as their new Medical Director and Chief of Adult Eating Disorders Services. Dr. Amelia Davis brings her years of experience and expertise gained as Medical Director and Chief of Eating Disorders at the University of Florida to her new post.

One of her recent UF colleagues, nationally recognized expert, Dr. Nicole Avena, PhD, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, also a researcher, academic and eating disorder expert says, ""Dr. Davis brought great passion and compassion to the Disordered Eating programs, not only by evaluating and treating University and other patients but also in in education and prevention. She will be a great asset to Rosewood. She brings with her a track record of success in eating disorders research and treatment, and I am confident this will continue in her new role as Medical Director.a

Dr. Davis developed an early passion for eating disorders patients. She was mentored and trained as a psychiatry resident by UFas Eating Disorder Recovery Center (EDRC) founder Kevin Wandler, M.D. who is 2015 President of iAEDP (International Association of Eating Disorders Professionals Foundation). During Dr. Davisas work with Dr. Wandler, UF's programs expanded from inpatient hospital- based to outpatient and became a comprehensive community-based eating disorders recovery center. Dr. Davisas leadership allowed the Eating Disorders inpatient unit to become recognized as a center of excellence for the evaluation and treatment of Eating Disordered patients with significant medical and psychiatric co-occurring illnesses. She followed many of them across the levels of care back to the University or home. For more information on Dr. Amelia Davis, visit ameliadavismd.com.

Twenty years after urging caution among parents who choose to discipline their children with spankings, the American Academy of Pediatrics has updated it",0.2,1,"PhotoAlto/Sandro Di Carlo Darsa, Getty Images

Twenty years after urging caution among parents who choose to discipline their children with spankings, the American Academy of Pediatrics has updated its stance. Now, its overwhelming consensus for parents: do not do it.

In a new policy statement issued earlier this month, the group warns that ""Aversive disciplinary strategies, including all forms of corporal punishment and yelling at or shaming children, are minimally effective in the short-term and not effective in the long-term. With new evidence, researchers link corporal punishment to an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.""

The advisory for parents and adults ""to avoid physical punishment and verbal abuse of children"" comes at a time when support of such discipline is on the decline. As the AAP detailed in its policy statement:

An analysis of a 2016 national survey conducted by yougov.com revealed that respondents with young children in the home, regardless of race and ethnicity, did not support corporal punishment, ""suggesting the possibility that a generational shift in social norms [about corporal punishment] may be taking place.

Despite these shifting attitudes, several states continue to have laws on the books that explicitly allow schools to perform corporal punishment, as NPR reported just last year.

""But the majority of states do not and I would hope that we would continue to shift in the direction of encouraging nonphysical punishment,"" said Dr. Jennifer Shu, pediatrician and author of Baby and Child Health: The Essential Guide from Birth to 11 Years, in an interview with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro.

Shu presented the AAP's findings alongside Dr. Robert Sege, an author of the updated policy Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children. She said the evidence shows that spankings do more harm than good when it comes to a child's development.

""We know that the brain does not grow and develop as well once there has been physical punishment to the point where it can cause learning problems, problems with vocabulary and memory, as well as aggressive behavior,"" Shu said.

Verbal reprimands were found by the AAP to be detrimental to a child's health as well.

""Anything that's verbally abusive in addition to being physically abusive can change the brain architecture,"" Shu said. ""Basically, these are adverse childhood events that can cause toxic stress that can lead to health problems as well as emotional problems as a child reaches the pre-teen and teen years.""

A less harmful way to discipline children effectively would be to reward good behavior and stay consistent with expectations, Shu said.

""Some children might respond to timeouts, a minute per year of age for ages 2 to 5 basically,"" Shu said. ""So sometimes having that timeout to take a break and regroup can help them calm down and then see why that behavior was not good.""

Though physical disicpline has been part of American culture for generations, Shu said the research is clear -- it is time for change.

""I think it's great that so many parents did get spanked growing up and turned out what seems to be ok, but knowing what we do now, we really need to avoid physical punishment because we know that can be harmful,"" Shu said.

And what does Shu think about the argument that people who received spankings as kids turned out fine? She compares it to growing up at a time when car seats weren't required for young children.

""There weren't any car seats, for example when I grew up, [and] we turned out fine - those of us who lived to tell about it,"" Shu said. ""But now that we have safety information and car seats, we do recommend that everybody use them all the time.""

""Basically, these are adverse childhood events that can cause toxic stress that can lead to health problems as well as emotional problems as a child reaches the pre-teen and teen years.""

A less harmful way to discipline children effectively would be to reward good behavior and stay consistent with expectations, Shu said.

""Some children might respond to timeouts, a minute per year of age for ages 2 to 5 basically,"" Shu said. ""So sometimes having that timeout to take a break and regroup can help them calm down and then see why that behavior was not good.""

Though physical disicpline has been part of American culture for generations, Shu said the research is clear -- it is time for change.

""I think it's great that so many parents did get spanked growing up and turned out what seems to be ok, but knowing what we do now, we really need to avoid physical punishment because we know that can be harmful,"" Shu said.

And what does Shu think about the argument that people who received spankings as kids turned out fine? She compares it to growing up at a time when car seats weren't required for young children.

""There weren't any car seats, for example when I grew up, [and] we turned out fine - those of us who lived to tell about it,"" Shu said. ""But now that we have safety information and car seats, we do recommend that everybody use them all the time.""

Now, its overwhelming consensus for parents: do not do it.<br><br>In a new policy statement issued earlier this month, the group warns that ""Aversive disciplinary strategies, including all forms of corporal punishment and yelling at or shaming children, are minimally effective in the short-term and not effective in the long-term. With new evidence, researchers link corporal punishment to an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.""<br><br>The advisory for parents and adults ""to avoid physical punishment and verbal abuse of children"" comes at a time when support of such discipline is on the decline. As the AAP detailed in its policy statement:<br><br>An analysis of a 2016 national survey conducted by yougov.com revealed that respondents with young children in the home, regardless of race and ethnicity, did not support corporal punishment, ""suggesting the possibility that a generational shift in social norms [about corporal punishment] may be taking place.<br><br>Despite these shifting attitudes, several states continue to have laws on the books that explicitly allow schools to perform corporal punishment, as NPR reported just last year.<br><br>""But the majority of states do not and I would hope that we would continue to shift in the direction of encouraging nonphysical punishment,"" said Dr. Jennifer Shu, pediatrician and author of Baby and Child Health: The Essential Guide from Birth to 11 Years, in an interview with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro.<br><br>Shu presented the AAP's findings alongside Dr. Robert Sege, an author of the updated policy Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children. She said the evidence shows that spankings do more harm than good when it comes to a child's development.<br><br>""We know that the brain does not grow and develop as well once there has been physical punishment to the point where it can cause learning problems, problems with vocabulary and memory, as well as aggressive behavior,"" Shu said.<br><br>Verbal reprimands were found by the AAP to be detrimental to a child's health as well.<br><br>""Anything that's verbally abusive in addition to being physically abusive can change the brain architecture,"" Shu said.

Samples of water and snow from across Antarctica contain tiny plastic fibers and traces of industrial chemicals, according to a new report from environmental advocacy group Greenpeace.

The findings come after a study last year analyzed existing samples of plastic fibers from Antarctica and found the presence too high to be accounted for only by local sources (such as research stations). The Greenpeace study collected samples from different parts of the region, including remoter parts of the continent, for testing. Until these findings, researchers thought ocean currents might shield Antarctica from pollution created by humans in lower latitudes, by creating a buffer zone.

The concentrations of the contaminants may not be large enough to be damaging to the local ecosystem now. But the ubiquity of plastic contamination--from tap water to the world's deepest point in the ocean to Antarctica--is alarming. Some scientists believe plastics have permanently damaged the earth.

During a three-month trip, Greenpeace researchers found that all eight (pdf, p.8) seawater samples contained man-made fiber. The fibers found included polyester, commonly used in clothes, and polypropylene, which is applied to packaging and electrical manufacturing.

Greenpeace researchers also looked at the snow--among the nine samples collected, seven contained polyfluorinated alkylated substances, or PFAs, which people use to make cookware and pizza boxes. PFAs are toxic chemicals that degrade very slowly and can accumulate in living organisms. They might have come to Antarctic with the help of ocean currents, noted the report (pdf, p.11).

While that direction may still be taken, the latest food craze is taking it back to grandma's house -- or great-grandma's house -- with bone broth, a variation on the chicken broth so many of our grandmothers used to feed us on a cold winter afternoon. Yeah, it may seem counterintuitive to bring back such a staple during a time when all these new foods are coming out, but this time it's all about the health benefits that come with it. Or so they say. Is bone broth as beneficial as it's cracked up to be?

The short answer is no. But that's not to say the supposed magical elixir isn't good for the body. First, though, let's cover what it actually is and what its benefits are supposed to be. ""Bone broth isn't all that different from the regular broth or stocks you see in recipes and soups,"" nutritionist Rania Batayneh, MPH, author of the best-selling book The One One One Diet: The Simple 1:1:1 Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss, told Medical Daily in an email. ""The main difference is the time it's spent simmering ... for up to 48 hours."" The bones, which can be anything from chicken to beef to fish, essentially disintegrate during this process, releasing whatever vitamins and minerals are inside.

All those vitamins and minerals have been said to go beyond the immune system-boosting benefits of chicken soup. Stores of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are supposed to be good for the bones and teeth. Meanwhile, all the gelatin and collagen -- considered the main protein holding the body together -- are supposed to improve digestive health; improve skin health; and strengthen joints, ligaments, tendons, hair, and nails. Some even suggest the broth could help reduce cellulite.

Of course, all of this sounds too good to be true because it is; staying healthy just isn't that easy (sorry guys). ""As of now, there is no clinical evidence that suggests bone broth provides any additional health benefits beyond normal broths,"" Batayneh said. For one, many of the nutrients the bones contain lose their healthful benefits as the broth simmers, NPR reported. And even if they don't lose those benefits, Batayneh said there's a good chance your typical health-conscious broth drinker is already getting the same nutrients through several other healthy foods.

The same can be said about gelatin and collagen. ""Simply eating collagen won't improve the health of the collagen already in your body, just as consuming tendons doesn't improve the health of tendons in your body,"" Batayneh said. Instead, the collagen will be broken down into amino acids, which are ""put to work in the body where they're needed most -- not necessarily to improve your complexion or heal an injury.""

Despite the fact many of these health benefits may just be hype, broth made with chicken bones, aka chicken soup, has been shown to boost immune health. A study from 2000, published in the journal Chest, found that participants who ate chicken soup experienced a slight reduction in their bodies' inflammatory responses to upper respiratory tract infections. The reason: the chicken soup inhibited neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, from responding. This reaction may be attributed to carnosine, a compound in chicken soup that's been found through another study to affect the immune system -- not only did it inhibit inflammation but it also prevented the virus from replicating.

In addition to its immune-boosting effects, bone broth may be most useful as a post-workout drink. All the aforementioned nutrients, plus potassium, make it a ""convenient post-exercise electrolyte replenishment drink,"" Batayneh said. It's in this way that bone broth can contribute to a person's overall health. Exercise and a balanced diet, which includes replacing all those candy bars and other unhealthy snacks with bone broth, reduces calorie intake and builds a strong healthy body.

So, while bone broth isn't a cure-all, that doesn't mean you shouldn't drink it. Just be sure to make it yourself; it's cheaper that way. Or, if you don't want to have a pot on the stove for 48 hours, ""spend your money on evidence-based nutrition guidelines,"" Batayneh said, such as ""more fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and fewer processed foods and sugars.""",10,3.3333333333333335,0,0.0,"Bone Broth Is All The Rage, But Does It Live Up To Its Reputation?","Ramen burgers and cronuts epitomized food crazes last year, and exemplified the direction in which contemporary cooking and baking might go.

Rungsima Wanitphakdeedecha, M.D., from Mahidol University in Bangkok, and colleagues evaluated VSP Er:YA laser for the treatment of striae in skin phototypes III-IV among 21 women treated monthly for two months. Treatment consisted of one side being treated with one pass of 400 mJ in short pulse (SP) mode with 50 percent overlapping and one pass of 2.2 J/cm2 in smooth (SM) mode with nonoverlapping. The other side was treated with two passes of 400 mJ in SP mode with 50 percent overlapping.

The researchers found that in both the SP-and-SM and SP-only groups, volume of striae distensae measured by Visioscan VC98 was reduced significantly at six-month follow-up. Skin roughness, skin smoothness, and surface measured by Visioscan VC98 did not differ between the groups. The most common side effect was transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which could last six months, in patients with darker skin tone and even in nonsun-exposure areas.

""Lower fluence should be used in patients with darker skin phototype to avoid the risk of PIH,"" conclude the authors.

This is one of the insights from a study in Springer's Journal of Business and Psychology, led by Magda Donia of the University of Ottawa in Canada.

Supervisors play an important role in making decisions about rewards and promotions within an organization. They should therefore be able to effectively distinguish between so-called ""good soldiers"" or ""good actors,"" to ensure that workers receive the recognition they deserve. Members of both groups are able to participate in positive organizational citizenship behavior in the workplace that goes beyond the mere basics of their job description. Whereas the ""soldiers"" actions are selflessly motivated by helping the organization and colleagues, ""actors"" are more self-servingly focused on furthering themselves.

Donia, along with co-authors Gary Johns from Concordia University, and Usman Raja from Brock University, tested whether supervisors can indeed successfully spot a good actor from a good soldier. Their study was conducted in 21 branches of an English-speaking multinational bank in Pakistan. Surveys were completed by 197 bank tellers and cashiers, and their 47 immediate supervisors.

They found that supervisors know with relative accuracy when employees' organizational citizenship behavior is selflessly or self-servingly motivated. This dispels concerns that the wrong judgment by supervisors might lead to the unfair reward or punishment of their subordinates.

Previous findings show that supervisors tend to prefer good soldiers from good actors. This study builds on these conclusions by suggesting that supervisors may have good reason for doing so. This might be because selfless and self-serving workers differ in the quality of what they contribute to an organization.

In light of this, Donia advises that it might therefore be more effective and meaningful for their own long term advancement in a company if employees selflessly work within an organizational setting.
