When a young athlete suddenly dies of a heart attack, chances are high that they suffer fr",0.3333333333333333,1,"This news or article is intended for readers with certain scientific or professional knowledge in the field.

When a young athlete suddenly dies of a heart attack, chances are high that they suffer from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Itis the most common genetic heart disease in the US and affects an estimated 1 in 500 people around the world. A protein called myosin acts as the molecular motor which makes the muscles in the heart contract.

Researchers had suspected for some time that the R403Q mutation in some of the myosin genes is among those that play a role in causing HCM. But experiments using mice models failed to show that this was indeed the case. (Mice are often used in experiments because their behaviour, biology and genetic material resemble those of humans).

An international team led by Professor Dilson Rassier from McGill's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education, has discovered, by working with transgenic rabbits with the R403Q mutation, that in these rabbits, individual myosin molecules and myofibrils (the basic rod-like filaments inside muscles) produce less force and a lower maximum velocity of contraction than those isolated from healthy hearts.

They reached this conclusion by using advanced techniques such as atomic force microscopy and molecular motility assays (which allows them to visualize the movements of these proteins in vitro) to look more closely at what was going on within myosin molecules and also within myofibrils.

""It's been difficult to gain a clear picture of what is going on within the myosin proteins with this mutation, simply because of the technical and experimental limitations of looking closely at objects of this minute size and measuring their force and motility (myosin molecules are about 19 nanometres (0.0000019 centimetres),"" explains Rassier. ""The results should help clinicians develop drugs and chemicals that target this specific function of myosin in future.""

The system would achieve this verification while safeguarding classified information that could lead to nuclear proliferation.

Scientists at Princeton University and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) are developing the prototype for such a system, as reported this week in Nature magazine. Their novel approach, called a ""zero-knowledge protocol,"" would verify the presence of warheads without collecting any classified information at all.

""The goal is to prove with as high confidence as required that an object is a true nuclear warhead while learning nothing about the materials and design of the warhead itself,"" said physicist Robert Goldston, coauthor of the paper, a fusion researcher and former director of PPPL, and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton.

While numerous efforts have been made over the years to develop systems for verifying the actual content of warheads covered by disarmament treaties, no such methods are currently in use for treaty verification.

Counting warheads

Traditional nuclear arms negotiations focus instead on the reduction of strategic -- or long-range -- delivery systems, such as bombers, submarines and ballistic missiles, without verifying their warheads. But this approach could prove insufficient when future talks turn to tactical and nondeployed nuclear weapons that are not on long-range systems. ""What we really want to do is count warheads,"" said physicist Alexander Glaser, first author of the paper and an assistant professor in Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

The system Glaser and Goldston are mapping out would compare a warhead to be inspected with a known true warhead to see if the weapons matched. This would be done by beaming high-energy neutrons into each warhead and recording how many neutrons passed through to detectors positioned on the other side. Neutrons that passed through would be added to those already ""preloaded"" into the detectors by the warheads' owner -- and if the total number of neutrons were the same for each warhead, the weapons would be found to match. But different totals would show that the putative warhead was really a spoof. Prior to the test, the inspector would decide which preloaded detector would go with which warhead.

No classified data would be measured in this process, and no electronic components that might be vulnerable to tampering and snooping would be used. ""This approach really is very interesting and elegant,"" said Steve Fetter, a professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and a former White House official. ""The main question is whether it can be implemented in practice.""

PPPL project

A project to test this approach is under construction at PPPL. The project calls for firing high-energy neutrons at a non-nuclear target, called a British Test Object, that will serve as a proxy for warheads. Researchers will compare results of the tests by noting how many neutrons pass through the target to bubble detectors that Yale University is designing for the project. The gel-filled detectors will add the neutrons that pass through to those already preloaded to produce a total for each test.

The project was launched with a seed grant from the Simons Foundation of Vancouver, Canada, that came to Princeton through Global Zero, a nonprofit organization. Support also was provided by the U.S. Department of State, the DOE (via PPPL pre-proposal development funding), and most recently, a total of $3.5 million over five years from the National Nuclear Security Administration.

Glaser hit upon the idea for a zero-knowledge proof over a lunch hosted by David Dobkin, a computer scientist, and until June 2014, dean of the Princeton faculty. ""I told him I was really interested in nuclear warhead verification without learning anything about the warhead itself,"" Glaser said. '""We call this a zero-knowledge proof in computer science,""' Glaser said Dobkin replied. ""That was the trigger,"" Glaser recalled. ""I went home and began reading about zero-knowledge proofs,"" which are widely used in applications such as verifying online passwords.

Disguising information

Glaser's reading led him to Boaz Barak, a senior researcher at Microsoft New England who had taught computer science at Princeton and is an expert in cryptology, the science of disguising secret information. ""We started having discussions,"" Glaser said of Barak, who helped develop statistical measures for the PPPL project and is the third coauthor of the paper in Nature.

Glaser also reached out to Goldston, with whom he had taught a class for three years in the Princeton Department of Astrophysical Sciences. ""I told Rob that we need neutrons for this project,"" Glaser recalled. ""And he said, 'That's what we do -- we have 14 MeV [or high-energy] neutrons at the Laboratory.'"" Glaser, Goldston and Barak then worked together to refine the concept, developing ways to assure that even the statistical noise -- or random variation -- in the measurements conveyed no information.

If proven successful, dedicated inspection systems based on radiation measurements, such as the one proposed here, could help to advance disarmament talks beyond the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between the United States and Russia, which runs from 2011 to 2021. The treaty calls for each country to reduce its arsenal of deployed strategic nuclear arms to 1,550 weapons, for a total of 3,100, by 2018.

Not included in the New START treaty are more than 4,000 nondeployed strategic and tactical weapons in each country's arsenal.

The eSMR Methanol technology exploits the full carbon potential of biogas by utilizing the 40% CO 2 content which is routinely separated and vented today. The technology heats the process using green electricity from wind turbines or solar panels instead of natural gas.

The demonstration plant will be located at Aarhus University's research facility in Foulum, Denmark, and receives funding from EUDP (Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program).

The demonstration plant, scheduled to be fully operational in the beginning of 2022, is expected to demonstrate that sustainable methanol production from biogas can compete with traditional methanol production based on fossil fuels.

We look forward to repeating the very promising results we have achieved in the laboratory at an industrial scale. We want to show that sustainable methanol can be produced from biogas at a cost similar to that of traditional methanol produced from fossil fuels. The eSMR Methanol technology is about 100 times smaller than the traditional units which makes it a very attractive solution for decentral biogas sites and world scale producers alike. --Peter Molgaard Mortensen, Principal Scientist at Haldor Topsoe

Today, biogas in grid quality is much costlier to produce than the natural gas it replaces. If biogas producers can produce sustainable methanol instead, they will be able to increase their production value significantly and compete on commercial terms with fossil-based products. Methanol is used as a clean fuel or an important intermediary in the production of many chemicals and polymers (plastics).

The eSMR Methanol process is CO 2 -neutral when based on biogas as feedstock and green electricity for heating. It even utilizes the CO 2 that makes up about 40% of biogas and typically is costly to separate and vent in production of grid quality biogas.





Heating principles. (A) Conventional fired reactor. (B) Electric resistance-heated reactor. Characteristic radial length scales and temperature profiles are shown across the heat source, reactor wall (gray), and catalyst material (green). In (B), the heat source and reactor wall are one. Illustrations are not to scale. Wismann et al.

eSMR Methanol is based on Topsoe's eSMR technology. The technology produces synthesis gas (syngas), an essential building block in production of polymers and chemicals. It may reduce the traditional steam reforming unit found in most chemical plants from the size of a six-story building, 30 meters in length, to just a few cubic meters. The extremely compact technology replaces the natural gas-fired heating of traditional steam reformers with direct electric heating of the catalytic process.





We see the electrified reactor as the next logical step for the chemical industry. With this approach, producers get a viable way to transform the industry going towards greener processes without increasing production cost. --Peter Molgaard Mortensen

""Our hope is that this biomaterial could fill in a major gap in technology available to treat corneal injuries,"" said co-corresponding author Reza Dana, MD, Director of the Cornea and Refractive Surgery Service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and the Claes H. Dohlman Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. ""We set out to create a material that is clear, strongly adhesive, and permits the cornea to not only close the defect, but also to regenerate. We wanted this material to allow the cells of the cornea to mesh with the adhesive and to regenerate over time to mimic something as close to the native cornea as possible.""

Corneal injuries are a common cause of visual impairment worldwide, with more than 1.5 million new cases of corneal blindness reported every year. The current standard of care for filling in cuts, thinning areas, or holes in the cornea (corneal defects) includes the use of synthetic glues or surgery to patch the eye with tissue and/or corneal transplants. The synthetic glues currently available are rough, inherently toxic to tissues, difficult to handle, and can lead to significant vision loss due to the material's opacity and poor integration with corneal tissues. Corneal transplants carry risks of post-transplant complications, including infection or rejection.

With the goal of addressing this unmet clinical need, researchers on the Science Advances report set out to develop an adhesive designed for long-term integration with the cornea.

The team engineered an adhesive biomaterial, GelCORE, made of chemically modified gelatin and photoinitiators, which are activated by a short-time exposure to blue light. Initially, the gel is a clear, viscous material designed to be applied with a dropper or syringe. When exposed to light, the material hardens, taking on the biomechanical features of a native cornea. And, over time, the cornea cells gradually grow into and become one with this material. Thus, GelCORE is similar to the native cornea -- highly transparent, able to bond to the native tissue, and capable of supporting cell and tissue regeneration.

Similar adhesive technologies have been designed for lung and other eye defects, but GelCORE is the first to use visible blue light as opposed to ultraviolet light, which carries a level of toxicity that blue light does not.

In the Science Advances report, the researchers describe their assessments of GelCORE in a preclinical model of corneal injury. They applied GelCORE at 20 percent concentration to corneal defects of 3mm, and then applied visible light for 4 minutes. Immediately after the light exposure, they observed firm adhesion of the gel to the corneal defect. One day later, they observed a transparent, smooth eye surface, with a surrounding cornea that was clear and without inflammation. One week after application, the gel could still be observed on the defect site in the cornea and remained transparent. Over time, the tissue showed signs of regeneration, with cells of the new tissue showing similarities between regenerated tissue and native tissue.

The study authors also note that the properties of GelCORE can be finely controlled by varying the concentration and the amount of time exposed to light -- offering the possibility of changing the formulation for different types and severities of eye injuries. ""We're now looking to make certain modifications for different applications,"" Dr. Dana said. ""We envision, if a patient comes in with a big laceration, they might receive formulation A. If they come in with a corneal scar, they might get formulation B."" The authors also hope to begin clinical trials to test the technology in human patients in approximately one year.

One of the most racially diverse U.S. cities, New York is also among the most starkly segregated. As a booming housing market spurs rapid gentrification, with white professionals often staking a wide claim within traditionally black and Latino New York City neighborhoods, how will these new arrivals affect neighborhood dynamics?

New research by Dr. Joscha Legewie, a sociologist at New York University, and Dr. Merlin Schaeffer of the University of Cologne, highlights an interesting aspect of the ""fuzzy,"" ill-defined boundaries between neighborhoods with vastly different racial makeups: These areas, claim the researchers, tend to have more conflicts between neighbors, even when you control for a host of other factors.

New York has many of these fuzzy boundaries. Perhaps the most historically notable is located on the east end of a white enclave in Brooklyn's Crown Heights South -- the site of infamous 1991 riots involving unrest between Jews and African-Americans that ultimately helped bring down the Dinkins administration. (Legewie hopes that future research into the fuzzy-boundary theory will expand to look at religious and socio-economic differences.) There, over the course of a couple of crosstown blocks heading eastward, the neighborhood shifts gradually from one that's mostly white into another that's more than 70 percent black; whereas on the west side of the enclave the black-white divide is sharply defined by a single street. Manhattan has the notorious East 96th Street color line: Below, the Upper East Side is vastly white and the city's richest neighborhood, while above the divide the average income plummets and the area is almost all Latino and black. Also, if you travel uptown on Broadway along the west side of the Columbia campus until you're just above 125th Street, you'll see the proportion of white people drop from two-thirds, to about 40 percent, and, once into Harlem, to just 3 percent.

Legewie and Schaeffer combed through local 311 records for complaints about noisy neighbors, blocked driveways, public drinking, and illegal use of apartments (as Airbnb rentals, for instance). Then they cross-referenced this trove of data with information about the city's racial composition from the 2010 Census. They also took boundary-detecting algorithms that are typically used to identify, say, the outline of someone's head in image processing or objects that self-driving cars should avoid, and used them to detect the zones in New York City in which there are gradual racial demographic shifts between two contrasting neighborhoods. (Legewie is set to present his research on August 22 at a conference of the American Sociological Association in Chicago, and has a tentative go-ahead to publish a corresponding paper in the American Journal of Sociology.) Overall, they found that neighbor-related complaints to 311 were 26 percent higher in fuzzy-boundary zones as compared with adjacent areas where there were more uniform racial demographics.

One obvious counterargument to this theory that fuzzy borders are hotbeds for racial tension: Perhaps it's simply diversity itself that causes the strife? Previous research, after all, has identified a link between diversity and discord. But when crunching their data, Legewie and Schaeffer controlled for racial diversity, as well as variables such as relative rates of poverty, unemployment, education, residential turnover, overall tendencies to make a fuss to 311, and whether residents were immigrants or English speakers. The differences persisted.

Legewie hopes his paper will inspire fellow sociologists to stop thinking of diversity in and of itself as a reason for tension between neighbors. Instead, he wants academics to broaden their lenses to consider the racial composition of the greater surrounding area as a possible factor influencing such social clashes. In these fuzzy-border cases, residents might have a certain expectation of how the culture of their neighborhood is supposed to be. But this notion may be based on the racial composition of an adjacent area; and as it turns out these people are actually living in something of a no-man's land, a transition zone between two neighborhoods that are each racially uniform, but in different ways -- and which therefore may have different local norms when it comes to issues like loud music or public drinking. Feeling out of place, these individuals aren't able to work out differences with neighbors with a simple knock on the door, so they start trying to defend their turf by raising a stink with the city about loud parties or someone renting out their place to tourists. Or so the theory goes.

This research tells a cautionary tale about the interpersonal problems that may arise as the city rapidly changes and gentrification continues its steady forward march. When asked about how Columbia's aggressive push into Harlem, for example, could spark interracial animosity, Legewie said that his research ""would suggest that expanding gentrification and pushing past these boundaries entails potential conflict.""

So, to get real, do these 311 rants ultimately boil down to cranky, territorial whites wailing about the proverbial Radio Raheem and his ghetto blaster? Unfortunately, 311 records lack racial information about the callers or their accused tormentors.

However, Legewie and his colleagues did look for such data by poring over comments on a popular web forum, citydata.com, where disgruntled New York City residents flock to moan about their neighbors. While the locations of the participants aren't identified, and this sample is biased by the fact that certain types of people are more likely to access such a site, Legewie said ""you clearly get the impression"" that there's an overall theme of white people complaining about black people.

As for how to temper discontent in the fuzzy-boundary zones, Legewie said, ""I don't think that there's a simple answer in terms of a policy that addresses that issue directly."" But as race relations remain critically fractious throughout the United States and turf wars erupt -- think of the McKinney, Texas, residents who apparently hurled racist slurs at the crowd of black teenagers using a community pool in June -- research such as this can at least help us better understand what sorts of conditions may give rise to neighbor-on-neighbor strife.

But as race relations remain critically fractious throughout the United States and turf wars erupt -- think of the McKinney, Texas, residents who apparently hurled racist slurs at the crowd of black teenagers using a community pool in June -- research such as this can at least help us better understand what sorts of conditions may give rise to neighbor-on-neighbor strife.

The finding by J",0.2222222222222222,1,"A Virginia Tech scientist has discovered a potentially new form of plant communication, one that allows them to share an extraordinary amount of genetic information with one another.

The finding by Jim Westwood, a professor of plant pathology, physiology, and weed science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, throws open the door to a new arena of science that explores how plants communicate with each other on a molecular level. It also gives scientists new insight into ways to fight parasitic weeds that wreak havoc on food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world.

His findings were published on Aug. 15 in the journal Science.

""The discovery of this novel form of inter-organism communication shows that this is happening a lot more than any one has previously realized,"" said Westwood, who is an affiliated researcher with the Fralin Life Science Institute. ""Now that we have found that they are sharing all this information, the next question is, 'What exactly are they telling each other?'.""

Westwood examined the relationship between a parasitic plant, dodder, and two host plants, Arabidopsis and tomatoes. In order to suck the moisture and nutrients out of the host plants, dodder uses an appendage called a haustorium to penetrate the plant. Westwood has previously broken new ground when he found that during this parasitic interaction, there is a transport of RNA between the two species. RNA translates information passed down from DNA, which is an organism's blueprint.

His new work expands this scope of this exchange and examines the mRNA, or messenger RNA, which sends messages within cells telling them which actions to take, such as which proteins to code. It was thought that mRNA was very fragile and short-lived, so transferring it between species was unimaginable.

But Westwood found that during this parasitic relationship, thousands upon thousands of mRNA molecules were being exchanged between both plants, creating this open dialogue between the species that allows them to freely communicate.

Through this exchange, the parasitic plants may be dictating what the host plant should do, such as lowering its defenses so that the parasitic plant can more easily attack it. Westwood's next project is aimed at finding out exactly what the mRNA are saying.

Using this newfound information, scientists can now examine if other organisms such a bacteria and fungi also exchange information in a similar fashion. His finding could also help solve issues of food scarcity.

""Parasitic plants such as witchweed and broomrape are serious problems for legumes and other crops that help feed some of the poorest regions in Africa and elsewhere,"" said Julie Scholes, a professor at the University of Sheffield, U.K., who is familiar with Westwood's work but was not part of this project. ""In addition to shedding new light on host-parasite communication, Westwood's findings have exciting implications for the design of novel control strategies based on disrupting the mRNA information that the parasite uses to reprogram the host.""

Westwood said that while his finding is fascinating, how this is applied will be equally as interesting.

""The beauty of this discovery is that this mRNA could be the Achilles hill for parasites,"" Westwood said. ""This is all really exciting because there are so many potential implications surrounding this new information.""",3.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,Plants may use newly discovered molecular language to communicate,"A Virginia Tech scientist has discovered a potentially new form of plant communication, one that allows them to share an extraordinary amount of genetic information with one another.

Follow Samantha Mathewson @Sam_Ashley13. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+. Original article on Space.com.",2589.0,"A team of astronomers has performed one of the highest resolution observations in astronomical history by observing two intense regions of radiation, 20 kilometres apart, around a star 6500 light-years away.

The observation is equivalent to using a telescope on Earth to see a flea on the surface of Pluto.

The extraordinary observation was made possible by the rare geometry and characteristics of a pair of stars orbiting each other. One is a cool, lightweight star called a brown dwarf, which features a ""wake"" or comet-like tail of gas. The other is an exotic, rapidly spinning star called a pulsar.

""The gas is acting as like a magnifying glass right in front of the pulsar,"" says Robert Main, lead author of the paper describing the observation being published May 24 in the journal Nature. ""We are essentially looking at the pulsar through a naturally occurring magnifier which periodically allows us to see the two regions separately.""

Main is a PhD astronomy student in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, working with colleagues at the University of Toronto's Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics and Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and the Perimeter Institute.

The pulsar is a neutron star that rotates rapidly -- over 600 times a second. As the pulsar spins, it emits beams of radiation from the two hotspots on its surface. The intense regions of radiation being observed are associated with the beams.

The brown dwarf star is about a third the diameter of the Sun. It is roughly two million kilometres from the pulsar -- or five times the distance between the Earth and the moon -- and orbits around it in just over 9 hours. The dwarf companion star is tidally locked to the pulsar so that one side always faces its pulsating companion, the way the moon is tidally locked to the Earth.

Because it is so close to the pulsar, the brown dwarf star is blasted by the strong radiation coming from its smaller companion. The intense radiation from the pulsar heats one side of the relatively cool dwarf star to the temperature of our Sun, or some 6000degC.

The blast from the pulsar could ultimately spell its companion's demise. Pulsars in these types of binary systems are called ""black widow"" pulsars. Just as a black widow spider eats its mate, it is thought that the pulsar, given the right conditions, could gradually erode gas from the dwarf star until the latter is consumed.

In addition to being an observation of incredibly high resolution, the result could be a clue to the nature of mysterious phenomena known as Fast Radio Bursts, or FRBs.

""Many observed properties of FRBs could be explained if they are being amplified by plasma lenses,"" say Main. ""The properties of the amplified pulses we detected in our study show a remarkable similarity to the bursts from the repeating FRB, suggesting that the repeating FRB may be lensed by plasma in its host galaxy.""

Additional notes:

1. The pulsar is designated PSR B1957+20. Previous work led by Main's co-author, Prof. Marten van Kerkwijk, from the University of Toronto, suggests that it is likely one of the most massive pulsars known, and further work to accurately measure its mass will help in understanding how matter behaves at the highest known densities, and equivalently, how massive a neutron star can be before collapsing into a black hole.

2. Main and his co-authors used data obtained with the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope before Hurricane Maria damaged the telescope in September 2017. The collaborators will use the telescope to make follow-up observations of PSR B1957+20."

Expert commentary, analysis and research comprise the journal supplement developed to engage in conversation about the need for public health education reform.

""Schools throughout the world have taken up this challenge. And as the collection of articles in this supplement demonstrates, there is no one-size-fits-all panacea. Innovation, as it should, has taken many forms in response to the needs of individual schools and their constituencies,"" wrote Linda Fried, MD, MPH, of Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, and George Thibault, MD, of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation in the issue's editor's choice paper, ""Reinventing public health education for the 21st century.""

The issue compiles recommendations and commentary on public health practice, school curriculum, professional development and the role of faculty and public health careers in the advancement of public health education. Papers take on topics including global health, public health competencies and innovations in the field and address all levels of public health education, including master level programs, doctoral programs and joint discipline programs.

Capturing a variety of perspectives, the supplement's content is informed through experts such as former Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Howard Koh, MD, MPH, alongside case studies and examples from various universities and public health programs. Among case studies referenced are an MBA/MPH program at Yale, a Public Health Innovations course at UC Berkeley and transformations in educational strategy at Harvard School of Public Health.

""Public health requires a deep and authentic commitment to team-based approaches. Our field requires a profound understanding that we are all interdependent and interconnected and we all have promises to keep,"" Koh writes in his editorial, ""The future of public health education: Preparing leaders.""

Papers in the issue also address methods to develop collaboration and synergy between other fields of study, approaches and disciplines, such as ""Bridging graduate education in public health and the liberal arts"" and ""Public health education for the 21st century at the University of Florida: Synergism between organizational capability and educational innovation.""

""Gone are the days, if they ever really existed, where public health professionals could work in the siloes of their various disciplines,"" Fried and Thibault explain.

""In collaboration with our colleagues from other health disciplines, we must lead health systems to focus on prevention and health across the life course and actively participate in redesigning those systems to promote prevention and evaluate impact,"" they write.

To overcome the material rigidity and actuation limitations in current robotic systems, a joint U.S. Army Research Laboratory and University of Minnesota research project sought inspiration from invertebrates.

The U.S. Army uses robots that are structurally rigid, making them impractical when performing military operations in highly congested and contested urban environments, where covert maneuvering is critical for gaining military superiority.

""Successful stealthy maneuvering requires high structural flexibility and distributive control to sneak into confined or restricted spaces, operate for extended periods and emulate biological morphologies and adaptability,"" said Dr. Ed Habtour, ARL researcher who specializes in nonlinear structural dynamics.

According to Habtour, current military robots have two major limitations that restrict them from mimicking the locomotion of biological organisms.

First, these robots lack the necessary dynamic flexibility, since they are mostly assembled with rigid mechanical and electronic components.

Second, rigid robots require complex mechanisms and electrical circuitries to achieve active actuation and complex modes of motion.

To overcome these limitations, a joint ARL and UMN research project sought inspiration from invertebrates.

This research effort led to the creation of soft actuator prototypes using active materials with remarkably tunable parameters, such as structural flexibility, morphology and dynamic actuation.

The prototype is the first fully 3-D printed dielectric elastomer actuator, or DEA, which can perform high bending motion.

The 3-D printed DEAs exhibited significantly larger deflections, three times more than other recent examples in scientific literature.

These results were published in Extreme Mechanics Letters (EML) in a paper entitled: ""3-D printed electrically-driven soft actuators"", 2018.

""In the initial phase of the project, our team began by investigating new methods for emulating the locomotion of invertebrates, which provided fundamental insights into the machineries of their soft distributed actuation circuitries that allow for high bending motions without skeletal support,"" said Professor Michael McAlpine of UMN.

Understanding the innate mechanisms of the distributive actuation observed in nature helped the team identify the important parameters that can be manipulated to accomplish novel functions, such as achieving highly flexible modes of motion.

According to McAlpine, to gain scientific insights into the importance of these parameters, it was necessary to first build and test a prototype similar to actuators found in nature via a custom-built 3-D printing platform, and to then develop a unified mathematical model to study the sensitivity of each parameter and predict the various optimal actuation mechanisms.

UMN 3-D printed distributed actuation circuitries involving soft, stretchable materials with mechanical properties similar to biological organisms such as cephalopods and worms.

ARL created a generalized model using an energetic formulation approach, which was key in identifying two important mechanisms for enabling high bending motion in soft biological actuators: (i) tuning physical properties (mechanical and geometric) via exploiting the interplay between the materials and dynamic nonlinearities to augment the motion; and (ii) highlighting the electromechanical coupling between the electrical field and nonlinear structural stiffness through the distributive actuation circuitries.

""The research findings represent an important stepping stone towards providing the Solider an autonomous freeform fabrication platform - next-generation 3-D printer, which can print functional materials and devices - to generate soft actuators and potentially tetherless soft robots on demand, on the fly and at the point of need,"" Habtour said.

Habtour noted that the research also suggests that soft actuators can be prime candidates for autonomous additive manufacturing in the battlefield.

""Unlike current 3-D printed DEAs, the new fabrication method does not require post-processing steps, such as assembly, drying or annealing,"" said lead author Ghazaleh Haghiashtiani. ""With the new 3-D printing method, the Solider can take advantage of the unique actuation properties of soft DEAs at the fundamental materials level with microscale resolution and complexity, with minimal prior expertise.""

As for next steps, Habtour said the intent is to develop the experimental and theoretical principles that govern the interplay between internal interfaces and kinetics of interactions in time-variant systems observed in biological organisms, which ensure their flexible locomotion and resilience.

""The intriguing interactions among the materials' micromechanical properties and various nonlinearities may provide new scientific opportunities to emulate the symbiotic interactions in biological systems,"" Habtour said. ""If we can understand these interactions, then we can use those insights to fabricate dynamic structures and flexible robots which are designed to be self-aware, self-sensing and capable of adjusting their morphologies and properties in real time to adapt to a myriad of external and internal conditions.""

With this, Habtour stated that the implications will be discovering emerging dynamics of living structures and emulating them, fabricating functionally complex structures and devices autonomously, and exploiting new modes of actuation not achievable in conventional robotic and mechanical systems.

UMN 3-D printed distributed actuation circuitries involving soft, stretchable materials with mechanical properties similar to biological organisms such as cephalopods and worms.

ARL created a generalized model using an energetic formulation approach, which was key in identifying two important mechanisms for enabling high bending motion in soft biological actuators: (i) tuning physical properties (mechanical and geometric) via exploiting the interplay between the materials and dynamic nonlinearities to augment the motion; and (ii) highlighting the electromechanical coupling between the electrical field and nonlinear structural stiffness through the distributive actuation circuitries.

""The research findings represent an important stepping stone towards providing the Solider an autonomous freeform fabrication platform - next-generation 3-D printer, which can print functional materials and devices - to generate soft actuators and potentially tetherless soft robots on demand, on the fly and at the point of need,"" Habtour said.

Habtour noted that the research also suggests that soft actuators can be prime candidates for autonomous additive manufacturing in the battlefield.

""Unlike current 3-D printed DEAs, the new fabrication method does not require post-processing steps, such as assembly, drying or annealing,"" said lead author Ghazaleh Haghiashtiani. ""With the new 3-D printing method, the Solider can take advantage of the unique actuation properties of soft DEAs at the fundamental materials level with microscale resolution and complexity, with minimal prior expertise.""

As for next steps, Habtour said the intent is to develop the experimental and theoretical principles that govern the interplay between internal interfaces and kinetics of interactions in time-variant systems observed in biological organisms, which ensure their flexible locomotion and resilience.

""The intriguing interactions among the materials' micromechanical properties and various nonlinearities may provide new scientific opportunities to emulate the symbiotic interactions in biological systems,"" Habtour said. ""If we can understand these interactions, then we can use those insights to fabricate dynamic structures and flexible robots which are designed to be self-aware, self-sensing and capable of adjusting their morphologies and properties in real time to adapt to a myriad of external and internal conditions."""

The rate of disease progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be associated with a poor prognosis in patients. A study recently investigated patients with RA through the number of poor prognostic factors (PPF), finding that the number of PPFs did not significantly predict biologic or biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (tsDMARD).The researchers used the Corrona Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry to identify biologic-naive patients who have been diagnosed with RA and had a 12-month follow-up, from January 2005 to December 2015.

Additionally, in the 0-1 group, 20.9% of patients received >=1 biologic, in the 2 PPF group 23.2% received >=1 biologic, and 26.5% of patients received >=1 biologic in the >=3 PPF group.The researchers found that tsDMARD use was similar in patients with and without PPF. Also, after adjusting for baseline CDAI, the mean change in CDAI was -4.95 for 0-1 PPF group, -4.53 for 2 PPF group, and -2.52 for the >=3 PPF group.
