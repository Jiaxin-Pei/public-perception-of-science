This was ac,0.2,1,"Counting and writing numbers are good but teaching kids how to identify patterns and compare quantities without counting can be a better strategy in introducing math to preschool students. This was according to the findings from a recent research.

The research, published in the journal Child Development, involved more than 500 children from low-income families between the ages of 4 and 11. The research had two phases because the goal was to determine whether the math skills of children can be determined as early as 4 years old.

The researchers tested the general and math skills of the kids. The math skills include counting, understanding written numbers, patterning, comparing quantities, calculating, and understanding shapes. This test took place when the kids were at the end of their preschool year.

The same kids were tested again when they reached their fifth grade. This time, the kids were tested the different ranges of their math knowledge. Through this, the researchers found that the math skills in preschool support the skills in first grade and son on. Moreover, they also found out that comparing quantities and patterning skills are strong indicators of math achievement in later years.

That's because children learn patterns naturally although they don't know the name of the object. According to an article on Bright Horizons, a child knows what is missing in a typical routine and, at the same time, they also know what c`omes next. For example, they know that in a typical routine a nap comes after they eat lunch.

Moreover, patterns occur naturally in our daily lives, such as the stripes on a shirt, the shapes of things around us, or the sounds we hear. That is also the reason why it's easy for kids to learn ""Heads, and shoulders, knees, and toes"" because the song represents a pattern. With that in mind, perhaps it's time preschool math takes a cue.",2.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,Preschool Math Should Focus On Patterns Not Numbers Research Say,"Counting and writing numbers are good but teaching kids how to identify patterns and compare quantities without counting can be a better strategy in introducing math to preschool students.

New research finds that children's math knowledge in preschool is related to their later achievement--and that early curricula could use some edits.

""Counting, calculating, and understanding written numbers already get a lot of attention from teachers and parents, for good reasons,"" says Bethany Rittle-Johnson, professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of education and human development, who led the study.

""However, comparing quantities may merit more attention in preschool, and patterning knowledge may merit more attention in both preschool and the early elementary grades.""

Common Core content standards for school math include shape but not patterning knowledge, and they focus little on comparing quantities.

Since patterning skills in the early years predicted math achievement in fifth grade in this study, Rittle-Johnson and her coauthors suggest teachers and parents engage young children in activities that help them find, extend, and discuss predictable sequences in objects (patterns) and compare quantities, without needing to count, such as estimating who has more pennies or more Halloween candy.

A next important step will be to systematically vary how much of this content young children receive and look at their math achievement over time.

The study followed 517 low-income children from ages 4 to 11. When the children were in the last year of preschool and near the end of first grade, researchers tested general skills (including self-regulated behavior, work-related skills, and reading) and six math skills (patterning, counting objects, comparing quantities, understanding written numbers, calculating, and understanding shapes).

When the children were at the end of fifth grade, researchers tested a range of math knowledge, including knowledge about numbers, algebra, and geometry. The aim of the study was to determine whether children's math skills at ages 4 and 5 predicted their math achievement at age 11.

The results suggest that preschool math skills supported first-grade math skills, which in turn supported fifth-grade math knowledge. In preschool, children's skills in patterning, comparing quantities, and counting objects were stronger predictors of their math achievement in fifth grade than other skills, the study found.

By first grade, patterning remained important, and understanding written numbers and calculating emerged as important predictors of later achievement.

""Our findings extend those of other studies that have focused on fewer math skills over shorter periods of time and that looked at children from more advantaged homes,"" explains Emily R. Fyfe, assistant professor of psychology at Indiana University, who was part of the study when she was a graduate student at Vanderbilt.

""This suggests that children from low-income homes develop math knowledge in ways similar to children from more-advantaged homes, and it supports a more comprehensive understanding of the trajectory of math development from the early years to the later years.""

The study appears in the journal Child Development.

Tinnitus and chronic pain have more in common than their ability to afflict millions with the very real experience of aEURoephantomaEUR sensations. Scientists noted similarities between the two disorders more than thirty years ago. Now advances in brain imaging and associated techniques have enabled researchers to begin homing in on their structural and functional bases, revealing what appears to be a central gatekeeping system implicated in both chronic pain and tinnitus. Collaborators at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Georgetown University Medical Center integrate the latest findings into a disease model of both disorders in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences.

Tinnitus sufferers hear sounds that arenaEUR(tm)t there, usually described as a ringing or buzzing aEURoein the earsaEUR even though such perceptions clearly arise in the brain. Hearing loss is often associated with tinnitus but does not adequately account for it. Furthermore, not everyone with damaged cochlear nerves or cortical auditory circuits experiences tinnitus. One hypothesis suggests that the decisive factor is whether or not a higher-level cognitive system responsible for aEURoetuning outaEUR negative sensory signals is working normally.

This view of tinnitus was hailed as a paradigm shift by people in the field when it was first proposed, in 2010, by Prof. Josef Rauschecker, Director of the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition at Georgetown University and a Hans Fischer Senior Fellow of the TUM Institute for Advanced Study. Mounting evidence has strengthened the case, as improved techniques allow higher-resolution studies of changes in the brain.

Converging lines of inquiry

Close collaboration between RauscheckeraEUR(tm)s lab and PainLabMunich, led by TUM Prof. Markus Ploner, has extended this research into the common ground that tinnitus shares with chronic pain. And that common ground now has an address in the brain. Structural and functional changes in the same brain circuit aEUR"" including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens aEUR"" can open the gateway to both tinnitus and pain that persists long past any acute cause.

The list of techniques that have contributed to this study is long and perhaps a bit esoteric-sounding, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, voxel-based morphometry, arterial spin labeling, positron emission tomography, and diffusion tensor imaging, as well as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. Results from these diverse approaches aEUR"" which essentially measure structural characteristics such as gray matter volume and functional properties such as network function aEUR"" have been correlated with and interpreted in the light of neurochemical studies.

New insights and cautious hope

In their new paper Rauschecker and Ploner, together with postdoctoral researchers Audrey Maudoux (Georgetown) and Elisabeth May (TUM), present copious evidence that similar structures and functional systems are involved in tinnitus and chronic pain and probably play a central role in both. Significant loss of gray matter and compromised circuit function are observed in the suspected regions, with considerable overlap between neurological changes in tinnitus and chronic pain sufferers.

All of these areas are also important for evaluating and modulating emotional experiences, Rauschecker says. aEURoeThese areas act as a central gatekeeping system for perceptual sensations, which determines the affective value of sensory stimuli aEUR"" whether produced externally or internally aEUR"" and modulates information flow in the brain. Tinnitus and chronic pain occur when this system is compromised.aEUR

The researchers propose that this newly identified gatekeeping system determines the relevance and affective value of sensory stimuli and controls information flow along pathways associated with the so-called executive functions.

Tinnitus and chronic pain have more in common than their ability to afflict millions with the very real experience of aEURoephantomaEUR sensations. Scientists noted similarities between the two disorders more than thirty years ago. Now advances in brain imaging and associated techniques have enabled researchers to begin homing in on their structural and functional bases, revealing what appears to be a central gatekeeping system implicated in both chronic pain and tinnitus. Collaborators at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Georgetown University Medical Center integrate the latest findings into a disease model of both disorders in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences.

Tinnitus sufferers hear sounds that arenaEUR(tm)t there, usually described as a ringing or buzzing aEURoein the earsaEUR even though such perceptions clearly arise in the brain. Hearing loss is often associated with tinnitus but does not adequately account for it. Furthermore, not everyone with damaged cochlear nerves or cortical auditory circuits experiences tinnitus. One hypothesis suggests that the decisive factor is whether or not a higher-level cognitive system responsible for aEURoetuning outaEUR negative sensory signals is working normally.

This view of tinnitus was hailed as a paradigm shift by people in the field when it was first proposed, in 2010, by Prof. Josef Rauschecker, Director of the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition at Georgetown University and a Hans Fischer Senior Fellow of the TUM Institute for Advanced Study. Mounting evidence has strengthened the case, as improved techniques allow higher-resolution studies of changes in the brain.

Converging lines of inquiry

Close collaboration between RauscheckeraEUR(tm)s lab and PainLabMunich, led by TUM Prof. Markus Ploner, has extended this research into the common ground that tinnitus shares with chronic pain. And that common ground now has an address in the brain. Structural and functional changes in the same brain circuit aEUR"" including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens aEUR"" can open the gateway to both tinnitus and pain that persists long past any acute cause.

The list of techniques that have contributed to this study is long and perhaps a bit esoteric-sounding, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, voxel-based morphometry, arterial spin labeling, positron emission tomography, and diffusion tensor imaging, as well as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. Results from these diverse approaches aEUR"" which essentially measure structural characteristics such as gray matter volume and functional properties such as network function aEUR"" have been correlated with and interpreted in the light of neurochemical studies.

New insights and cautious hope

In their new paper Rauschecker and Ploner, together with postdoctoral researchers Audrey Maudoux (Georgetown) and Elisabeth May (TUM), present copious evidence that similar structures and functional systems are involved in tinnitus and chronic pain and probably play a central role in both. Significant loss of gray matter and compromised circuit function are observed in the suspected regions, with considerable overlap between neurological changes in tinnitus and chronic pain sufferers.

All of these areas are also important for evaluating and modulating emotional experiences, Rauschecker says. aEURoeThese areas act as a central gatekeeping system for perceptual sensations, which determines the affective value of sensory stimuli aEUR"" whether produced externally or internally aEUR"" and modulates information flow in the brain. Tinnitus and chronic pain occur when this system is compromised.aEUR

The researchers propose that this newly identified gatekeeping system determines the relevance and affective value of sensory stimuli and controls information flow along pathways associated with the so-called executive functions. The process, they say, is controlled by two major neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin. Damage to this system, they argue, affects the perception of sensory signals in such a way that either tinnitus or chronic pain can develop and carry on in a self-perpetuating loop.

They stress that there are still a number of open questions, particularly in relation to potential clinical interventions. Yet they see reason to be cautiously optimistic.

Levi's research evaluated school-aged children and found that children with high language skills - a better ability to understand and process language - were able to understand speech well both by speakers they were familiar with and by speakers who had a similar accent. Children with lower language skills understood speech from familiar speakers well, but found it more challenging to understand speakers who they did not know.

""These findings suggest that children who have lower language skills are able to understand speech from familiar speakers, as would be the case with a teacher or parent, but may have a harder time with new speakers, such as a substitute teacher or when interacting with other people in their day to day interactions,"" said Susannah Levi, NYU Steinhardt professor and the study's lead author.

Levi previously published research showing that when school-aged children are familiar with someone's voice or accent, they can more accurately and quickly process what a person is saying - a concept known as ""familiar talker advantage."" The new research, published in the Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, by Levi and her co-authors examined how this advantage is impacted by a child's language ability.

With the concept ""familiar talker advantage,"" child listeners naturally store information about what they hear and the way words sound when spoken from people they know. Each time a child is spoken to they go back to this stored information to process and understand words that are spoken to them. This new research demonstrates that children with poorer language skills have a more difficult time retrieving and processing this information.

The current study included children with a range of language abilities who completed spoken word recognition tasks in which they heard words mixed with background noise and had to indicate what word they heard. The tasks required children to identify words spoken by voices and accents they were familiar with as well as three unfamiliar voices.

In addition to Levi, the study was co-authored by Daphna Harel, assistant professor of applied statistics at NYU Steinhardt and Richard G. Schwartz, a professor at the City University of New York.

Jessica A. Reese, Ph.D., from the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City, and colleagues examined platelet counts throughout pregnancy in 7,351 women who delivered between 2011 and 2014. Platelet counts were compared with those of non-pregnant women included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 through 2012.

The researchers found that 4,568 women had uncomplicated pregnancies, 2,586 had pregnancy-related complications, and 197 had pre-existing disorders associated with thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count in the first trimester was 251,000/mm3 among women with uncomplicated pregnancies, compared with the mean platelet count of 273,000/mm3 among the 8,885 non-pregnant women (P < 0.001). Overall, 9.9 percent of women with uncomplicated pregnancies had a platelet count below 150,000/mm3 at the time of delivery. Only 45 women (1 percent) had a platelet count below 100,000/mm3 during the course of the uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. Women who had pregnancy-related complications more often had platelet counts of less than 150,000/mm3 at the time of delivery than women with uncomplicated pregnancies (11.9 versus 9.9 percent).

A team of scientists, led by Sandra Pizzarello, a research professor in ASU's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, found that the Sutter's Mill meteorite, which dropped to Earth over California in April 2012, contains never-seen-before organic molecules.

""The analyses of meteorites never cease to surprise you ... and make you wonder,"" Pizzarello said, in a statement. ""This is a meteorite whose organics had been found altered by heat and of little appeal for bio- or prebiotic chemistry, yet the very Solar System processes that lead to its alteration seem also to have brought about novel and complex molecules of definite prebiotic interest such as polyethers.""

The findings suggest that the existence of a greater number of extraterrestrial organic molecules, which could have been important in molecular evolution and life itself, is possible, according to the study recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Pizzarello and her team hydrothermally treated fragments of the meteorite to detect the compounds. The hydrothermal conditions of the experiments, which mimic early Earth settings (a proximity to volcanic activity and impact craters), released a complex mixture of oxygen-rich compounds.

Scientists believe that these compounds could be the result of oxidative processes that occurred in the meteorite.

According to the researchers, the latest discovery is an addition to the inventory of organic compounds produced in extraterrestrial environments, promoting the discourse that their delivery to prehistoric Earth by comets and meteorites might have aided the molecular evolution that preceded the origins of life.

Because meteorites can be rich in organic compounds, their composition ""has always been seen as an indication that the precursors to the evolution that led to the origins of life could have come from the extraterrestrial material of meteorites,"" Space.com quoted Pizzarello as saying.

Scientists have discovered unexpected ingredients for life -- organic molecules never seen before in meteorites -- inside a chunk of space rock that fell to Earth over California last year, scientists say.

The discovery comes from an analysis of the so-called Sutter's Mill meteorite, which lit up the California night sky with a dazzling fireball in April 2012. Meteorite fragments from the event may shed light on the primordial ooze that helped give rise to life on Earth, researchers said.

""Since the origins of life are utterly unknown, the idea has its merits.""

Pizzarello and her colleagues analyzed two fragments of the Sutter's Mill meteorite, which streaked through the skies on April 22, 2012, crashing in California. Fragments of this meteorite were given to researchers who have worked on similar rocks before, including Pizzarello.

The organic chemicals in meteorites can get extracted with the aid of solvents. Speculation regarding the origin of life is based on the notion that it arose from a ""prebiotic"" soup of organic molecules, perhaps delivered in part by meteorites. Initially, fragments of the Sutter's Mill meteorite apparently possessed fewer dissolvable organic compounds left after solvent extraction compared to other similar meteorites.

""You may say that it was a disappointment,"" Pizzarello said.

However, the researchers tried dissolving the fragments in conditions mimicking hydrothermal vents on Earth, the environment often seen in the early Earth that life might have arisen within. Upon such treatment, the rocks released organic molecules not previously detected in similar meteorites. The findings that suggest there are far more organic materials available via meteorite for planetary environments than scientists assumed.

Scientists investigating the origin of life often suppose dissolved compounds desirable for life need to first have gotten concentrated and held together somehow, much as cell membranes do for the cell's components. The organic molecules the researchers discovered in the Sutter's Mill fragments ""could be good for such a purpose, because they can form rudimentary enclosures to contain compounds useful to prebiotic evolution,"" Pizzarello said.

The scientists detailed their findings online today (Sept. 9) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Scientists investigating the origin of life often suppose dissolved compounds desirable for life need to first have gotten concentrated and held together somehow, much as cell membranes do for the cell's components. The organic molecules the researchers discovered in the Sutter's Mill fragments ""could be good for such a purpose, because they can form rudimentary enclosures to contain compounds useful to prebiotic evolution,"" Pizzarello said.

The scientists detailed their findings online today (Sept. 9) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Breast cancer diagnoses can be facilitated with use of a needle biopsy, however, a study has reported that needle biopsies are not used enough. The authors of the study stated that the results indicated that underuse of needle biopsies has a negative impact on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The study included data on the influence of surgeons on the use of needle biopsies for diagnosis.

The study was carried out at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center by a group of researchers led by Dr. Benjamin Smith. Nationwide medicare data from 2003 to 2007 were used and data from 89,712 patients with breast cancer who previously had surgery were included in the analysis. The study also included information about 12,405 surgeons who treated the patients.

Three outcome measures were analyzed in the study. Whether a surgeon was consulted before versus after a biopsy was one of the factors considered. Use of a needle biopsy (yes or no) was the second factor analyzed, and the third factor was the number of surgeries that were performed for cancer treatment on each patient. The study showed that 68 percent of the patients had a needle biopsy. Only about 54 percent of these patients were seen by a surgeon previous to having a biopsy. Medicaid coverage, rural residence more than about eight miles from a facility that performed needle biopsies and no mammogram within two months before consultation were found to be influences that played a role in the outcomes.

The study indicated that the risk of having multiple surgeries for breast cancer was about 34 percent for patients that had a needle biopsy and the risk of multiple cancer surgeries was about 70 percent for those who did not have a needle biopsy. This difference in the rates of having multiple surgeries was found to be statistically significant. This statistic suggested that the outcome is much better for those who have a needle biopsy for breast cancer diagnosis. The authors of the study stated that surgeon-level interventions may help to increase the use of needle biopsies for breast cancer diagnosis and thereby may increase the quality of care.

Surgeon experience was shown to be important in the study. Needle biopsies for breast cancer diagnosis were not used enough by inexperienced surgeons. A biopsy in which a sample is extracted through a small incision is the alternative to having a needle biopsy. An excisional biopsy requires a three to four centimeter incision to remove the tumor sample and this is more painful and will take longer to heal than the puncture wound of a needle biopsy.

The initial discovery of a potentially cancerous tumor in the breast usually results from a mammogram. Then the next step is to have a biopsy of the lump (or tumor). If the biopsy results are positive for cancer then surgery may be warranted. The process of diagnosing a breast lump can be challenging. The results from this study suggest that women should consider the experience level of a surgeon when facing the possibility of having breast cancer and they should also request having a needle biopsy if warranted. Needle biopsies not being used enough for breast cancer diagnosis means more women faced surgeries that possibly could have been avoided.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, also finds that patients are often influenced by surgeons to undergo the unnecessary surgery -- a decision that's costly and can negatively impact their diagnosis and treatment.

A needle biopsy is a non-surgical procedure typically performed by a radiologist that uses a thin needle to remove sample tissue from the breast. The procedure was originally endorsed as a reasonable standard of care in 1997 by a Joint Task Force comprising the American College of Surgeons (ACS), College of American Pathologists and American College of Radiologists. The procedure was endorsed as a quality measure by the ACS in 2006, says Benjamin Smith, MD, associate professor in MD Anderson's departments of Radiation Oncology and Health Services Research. ""Still too often in my practice, I see patients that come to MD Anderson for care after having an excisional biopsy performed for diagnosis, when they obviously could have had a needle biopsy,"" says Smith, the study's corresponding author. ""Often, the excisional biopsy negatively affects other aspects of breast cancer treatment and is simply a wasteful procedure. With this study, we wanted to quantitate the magnitude of that waste on a national scale, and identify some of the impacts of that practice pattern on the well-being of patients.""

For the retrospective study, Smith and his colleagues reviewed Medicare claims of 89,712 patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2003-2007. All were treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation. The study also identified 11,279 diagnosing surgeons and 12,405 treating surgeons. Of the patients, 68.4 percent (61,353) underwent a needle biopsy, with the rate of those undergoing the procedure increasing from 60.8 percent in 2003 to 76.5 percent in 2007. Of the total cohort, 68.4 percent of the patients consulted with a surgeon prior to a biopsy and 31.6 percent saw a surgeon after their biopsy. Of the patients who saw a surgeon upfront: 46.3 percent did not have a needle biopsy; 38.4 percent underwent the procedure, but performed by their surgeon; and 15.4 percent had the needle biopsy performed by a radiologist. In contrast, all patients who saw a surgeon post-biopsy underwent the needle biopsy.

The researchers found that surgeon characteristics associated with excisional biopsy included: lack of board certification; training outside the U.S.; medical school graduation before 1980 and low case volume. Also, patient characteristics most associated with surgeon consultation before biopsy, and thus a lower rate of needle biopsy, were: older age; black race; Medicaid coverage; co-morbid illness; earlier year of diagnosis and rural residence. Geographical discrepancies in the rate of needle biopsies performed were noted -- the researchers contrast the low rate of 24.1 percent in Bismarck, North Dakota to a high of 97.2 percent in Lynchburg, Virginia. Yet, Smith notes that access issues were far less of a factor for the decision than that of the surgeon's influence.

""The real question is the role of the surgeon and to understand that influence. With our study, we set up a statistical model that allowed us to compare the impact of patient-to-surgeon factors. While there are access issues that should be addressed, it's clear that the surgeon's role is very important for the patients' care,"" explains Smith.

Excisional biopsies were negatively associated with multiple breast cancer surgeries, 69.6 percent, compared to 33.7 percent of those who did not undergo the surgery. For patients, says Smith, it's important to know that needle biopsy is considered the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, it's relatively readily accessible, and there are possible medical benefits of making the right decision -- such as preventing additional surgeries and enduring fewer complications.

""An open surgical biopsy actually makes lymph node biopsy less accurate -- and lymph node status is the most important factor when making critical decisions about adjuvant therapy. So breast cancer patients should be fully educated that this is the standard of care and ask for it,"" stressed Smith. ""For physicians, I think our findings suggest an opportunity to educate and encourage them to do the right thing in the best interest of their patient,"" Smith continued.

Needle biopsy, the standard of care radiological procedure for diagnosing breast cancer, is underused with ",0.1904761904761904,1,"Needle biopsy underused in breast cancer diagnosis, negatively impacting diagnosis and care

Needle biopsy, the standard of care radiological procedure for diagnosing breast cancer, is underused with too many patients undergoing the more invasive, excisional biopsy to detect their disease, according to research from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, also finds that patients are often influenced by surgeons to undergo the unnecessary surgery -- a decision that's costly and can negatively impact their diagnosis and treatment.

A needle biopsy is a non-surgical procedure typically performed by a radiologist that uses a thin needle to remove sample tissue from the breast. The procedure was originally endorsed as a reasonable standard of care in 1997 by a Joint Task Force comprising the American College of Surgeons (ACS), College of American Pathologists and American College of Radiologists.

The procedure was endorsed as a quality measure by the ACS in 2006, says Benjamin Smith, MD, associate professor in MD Anderson's departments of Radiation Oncology and Health Services Research.

""Still too often in my practice, I see patients that come to MD Anderson for care after having an excisional biopsy performed for diagnosis, when they obviously could have had a needle biopsy,"" says Smith, the study's corresponding author. ""Often, the excisional biopsy negatively affects other aspects of breast cancer treatment and is simply a wasteful procedure. With this study, we wanted to quantitate the magnitude of that waste on a national scale, and identify some of the impacts of that practice pattern on the well-being of patients.""

For the retrospective study, Smith and his colleagues reviewed Medicare claims of 89,712 patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2003-2007. All were treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation. The study also identified 11,279 diagnosing surgeons and 12,405 treating surgeons. Of the patients, 68.4 percent (61,353) underwent a needle biopsy, with the rate of those undergoing the procedure increasing from 60.8 percent in 2003 to 76.5 percent in 2007.

Of the total cohort, 68.4 percent of the patients consulted with a surgeon prior to a biopsy and 31.6 percent saw a surgeon after their biopsy. Of the patients who saw a surgeon upfront: 46.3 percent did not have a needle biopsy; 38.4 percent underwent the procedure, but performed by their surgeon; and 15.4 percent had the needle biopsy performed by a radiologist. In contrast, all patients who saw a surgeon post-biopsy underwent the needle biopsy.

The researchers found that surgeon characteristics associated with excisional biopsy included: lack of board certification; training outside the U.S.; medical school graduation before 1980 and low case volume. Also, patient characteristics most associated with surgeon consultation before biopsy, and thus a lower rate of needle biopsy, were: older age; black race; Medicaid coverage; co-morbid illness; earlier year of diagnosis and rural residence.

Geographical discrepancies in the rate of needle biopsies performed were noted -- the researchers contrast the low rate of 24.1 percent in Bismarck, North Dakota to a high of 97.2 percent in Lynchburg, Virginia. Yet, Smith notes that access issues were far less of a factor for the decision than that of the surgeon's influence.

""The real question is the role of the surgeon and to understand that influence. With our study, we set up a statistical model that allowed us to compare the impact of patient-to-surgeon factors. While there are access issues that should be addressed, it's clear that the surgeon's role is very important for the patients' care,"" explains Smith.

Excisional biopsies were negatively associated with multiple breast cancer surgeries, 69.6 percent, compared to 33.7 percent of those who did not undergo the surgery.

For patients, says Smith, it's important to know that needle biopsy is considered the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, it's relatively readily accessible, and there are possible medical benefits of making the right decision -- such as preventing additional surgeries and enduring fewer complications.

""An open surgical biopsy actually makes lymph node biopsy less accurate -- and lymph node status is the most important factor when making critical decisions about adjuvant therapy. So breast cancer patients should be fully educated that this is the standard of care and ask for it,"" stressed Smith.

""For physicians, I think our findings suggest an opportunity to educate and encourage them to do the right thing in the best interest of their patient,"" Smith continued.

Psychology Women Beat Expectations When Playing...

Data from 160,000 ranked chess players and more than 5 million chess matches suggest that women playing against men perform better than expected based on their official chess ratings, according to new findings published in Psychological Science. The study results indicate that women players are not affected by negative stereotypes about women's chess abilities during competition games, in contrast with previous research on the phenomenon of ""stereotype threat"" which has suggested that awareness of negative stereotypes can hamper women's performance.

""These findings show that even famous psychological phenomena may not be present all the time. Factors other than stereotype threat appear to be more important in determining men and women's tournament chess performance,"" says psychological scientist and study author Tom Stafford of The University of Sheffield.

""Looking at such a large real-world sample allows us a lot of confidence that our numbers are reliable,"" Stafford adds.

Being aware of a negative stereotype is thought to make individuals more anxious, more self-conscious, and less able to suppress negative thoughts - outcomes that ultimately hamper their ability to perform the task at hand.

Because women are noticeably underrepresented in the world of competitive chess, stereotype threat may be especially salient to women chess players. Previous experiments have provided some evidence for stereotype threat in chess, suggesting that women were less likely to win a match when they believed they were playing a male opponent.

To investigate this phenomenon in the real world, Stafford analyzed data from standard tournament chess games played between rated players from January 2008 through August 2015. The FIDE rating system continuously incorporates game outcomes to update players' ratings. These ratings can be used to predict who will win in a match between any two players. In total, the analyses included data from 150,977 men and 16,158 women playing in 5,558,110 games.

Overall, men had a slightly higher average FIDE rating than women. But the game outcomes indicated that women won matches against men more often than would have been predicted given each player's rating. This pattern held across the whole range of rating differences.

In other words, women outperformed expectations when playing a man compared with when they played against other women, a finding that runs contrary to the negative effect that one would expect as a result of stereotype threat.

The findings surprised Stafford and he notes that any conclusions are limited to the context of tournament chess and rated players.

""The news is good for female chess players, of whom there are exploding numbers. Although discrimination is real and pervasive, women playing tournament chess do not seem to be at a disadvantage when paired with men,"" Stafford says.

""This study of one social attitude in one domain-gender stereotypes in chess-does nothing to disprove the reality of discrimination generally, but it does suggest that this one mechanism, stereotype threat, may be more limited in its applicability than one might conclude from reading the experimental literature alone,"" Stafford concludes in his research article.

The breakthrough could help to provide ",0.5,1,"Researchers have made a breakthrough which could help prevent patients suffering stress to the body and from feeling pain or becoming aware during anaesthesia.

The breakthrough could help to provide a new guide for anaesthetists and lead to much quicker recovery times for patients following operations as greater optimisation of dosage could lead to drugs being significantly reduced.

If drug levels are judged incorrectly this has led to well documented, albeit very rare, cases of patients becoming aware or feeling pain during surgery due to insufficient dose of anaesthetic drugs. Also, overdosing of drugs may be harmful, resulting in cardiovascular malfunction and prolonged delay in awakening after surgery.

In a study published in the journal Anaesthesia (September 9) researchers tested a new more nuanced form of investigating the subtle clues sent out by the human body during anaesthesia - particularly the cardiovascular signals that can indicate the state of the pain-monitoring autonomous nervous system. The results have proved more reliable than existing methods.

The journal article - 'The Discriminatory value of Cardiorespiratory Interactions in distinguishing awake from anaesthetised states: A randomised observational study' - found that by looking at how key indicators - such as ECG, respiration, skin temperature, pulse and skin conductivity - interacted with one another researchers could much more accurately predict whether a patient was awake or anaesthetised. They also helped distinguish between the effects of two commonly-used anaesthetic drugs, propofol and sevoflurane.

The study measured the depth of anaesthesia of 27 patients in good health during surgery in the United Kingdom and in Norway. Readings were taken at a high frequency - several hundred samples per heart beat - for 30 minutes while the patients were awake before their surgery and for up to 30 minutes during general anaesthesia. The signals showed, with a high degree of accuracy, how the patients reacted to the anaesthetics.

Lancaster University's Professor Aneta Stefanovska said: ""We have developed new methods to study complex interactions between ever changing processes such as the processes in our heart, lungs and vasculature. These physiological processes constantly interact with one another but anaesthetic drugs change the level of these interactions. By applying our new methods, in this study we were able to get a very accurate picture of what was going on, leading to the most reliable predictions of the state of anaesthesia obtained from cardiovascular signals to date of closer to 97 per cent.""

The study has been welcomed by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI).

Professor Andrew Hartle, President of the AAGBI, explained: ""Anaesthesia is a complex process based on physiological measurements, combined with the skill and expertise of anaesthetists to keep the patient at the right depth of unconsciousness through the correct dosing of potent drugs. We warmly welcome any new research which further improves patient care.""

Professor Peter McClintock, also of Lancaster University, said: ""The likelihood of waking up during surgery is extremely small but, if it happened, it could be a distressing experience. So we are delighted to pave the way to a new tool for gauging depth of anaesthesia.""

The collaborative research involved consultant anaesthetists from University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust in North West England.

Professor Andrew Smith, Consultant Anaesthetist, Royal Lancaster Infirmary said: ""This publication is highly topical given the recent audit on accidental awareness under general anaesthesia conducted by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) and the Royal College of Anaesthetists. Whilst it is early days, the prospect of a monitor of anaesthetic depth that relies on measurements of the circulation and respiration is very attractive. I look forward to further collaboration with Lancaster University in the interests of enhancing the care of patients in the NHS locally and nationally in the future.""

Johan Raeder, Professor in Anaesthesiology at Oslo University Hospital, who also took part in the study, said: ""This very complex work is a logical step further in the search for specific and sensitive methods of objectively detecting the state of anaesthesia.

""While so far most methods have relied on a single kind of measurement, our work tries to integrate information from many different physiological processes at the same time, thus adding an entirely new perspective. Namely how the different processes interact with each other and synchronise.""

Just like tra",0.5384615384615384,1,"Easing bacterial traffic jams (Nanowerk News) Controlling the motion of swimming bacteria could benefit applications including microscopic transport, biomedicine and even microrobotics.

Just like traffic engineers design the flow of traffic, scientists at the Department of Energys (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have developed a way to control the motion of swimming bacteria using 3-D-printed microscopic pillars (Nature Communications, ""Engineering bacterial vortex lattice via direct laser lithography"").

Manipulating the bacteria could aid in the development of new materials with unusual properties for many applications, including microscopic transport, biomedicine and even microrobotics.

Argonne scientists have introduced a set of 3D-printed columns that can control the swimming motion of bacteria, which could lead to the development of new applications in microrobotics and biomedicine. (Image: Argonne National Laboratory)

When suspended in drops of water, the bacterial ?swimmers will shoot around chaotically, together forming tiny, unstable tornados that drift, decay and annihilate each other. The scientists discovered that when they introduce an array of microscopic towers into the turbulent bacterial bath, the swimmers self-organize into a coherent structure of vortices around the towers.

You can think of this like chaotic motion of cars in an open lot, said Argonnes Andrey Sokolov, a scientist on the study. ?When you introduce tiny objects into the system, like traffic cones, the chaotic motion self-organizes into ordered motion.

The ?traffic cones in this experiment are vertical pillars 10 times thinner than the thickness of a hair. The scientists produce the towers, made of photopolymer, using a state-of-the-art 3-D printing process called multiphoton lithography within Argonnes Materials Science division.

When the scientists immerse the towers in the bacterial suspension, the swimmers form a lattice of vortices whose directions of rotation alternate like the colors on a checkerboard. This pattern, which scientists call antiferromagnetic order, is most famously displayed by the spinning electrons inside some magnetic materials.

Usually, we hear the words ?vortex and ?antiferromagnetic in the context of magnetic systems and superconductors, said Sokolov, ?but we observed a remarkably similar structure in a very different system  a biological system.

In addition, the scientists discovered that the direction of the individual vortices can be further controlled with the introduction of chiral towers, or small pillars with slats on the sides. The bacteria will swim clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of the slats in the towers around them. Using this technique, the scientists can manipulate the vortices and design a wide range of patterns on demand.

The effect that these towers have on the bacterial ?hive mind is still somewhat mysterious to the scientists. The towers take up only around five percent of the area in the system, but they have a profound effect on bacterial motion. Through the experiments, the scientists determined that the effect is controlled by the spacing of the towers.

The patterns are strongest when the pillar spacing is on the same scale as the size of the typical vortex when the bacteria are unconstrained, said Sokolov.

The study is part of a larger investigation of active matter, or matter that continuously consumes energy and uses it for mechanical motion. Countless examples of active matter show up in everyday life, including flocks of birds, swarms of bees or even rice on a shaking pan. Scientists are trying to control these systems to have them accomplish particular tasks, such as transporting a microscopic object over a material like a rock star surfing a crowd.

The bacterial suspension in this study is active matter because the bacteria constantly convert chemical energy from nutrients into mechanical energy to swim. ?The outcome of our research is a new way to manipulate active matter on a microscopic level, said Sokolov.",9.0,0.6923076923076923,0.0,0.0,Easing bacterial traffic jams,"Easing bacterial traffic jams (Nanowerk News) Controlling the motion of swimming bacteria could benefit applications including microscopic transport, biomedicine and even microrobotics.

We're just saying our relationship has gotten a little, well, dry. Plus, nitrates, which are added to many meat jerkies, are getting a worse and worse rap due to correlations with colorectal cancer and now manic episodes for people with bipolar disorder.

Sure, you can buy nitrate-free jerky, but you could also try something completely new: alt jerky.

As the ever-shifting diet pendulum has swung from paleo to vegan, the jerky market has followed. (Check out this fun Google Trends graph mapping the two eating styles over the past five years.) Of course, you can still find ""primal style"" dried-meat strips and bars, but jerkies made from mushrooms, bugs, seaweed, and even coconut are also in the mix.

Are these even really jerky? We say yes.

The term jerky comes from the Quechua word ch'arki, which originally referred to dried meat--most likely alpaca. The livestock industry may take issue with us expanding the definition to include other dehydrated options the way it reacted to nut milks branding themselves as milk. But these products are shelf-stable, savory, nutritious, and give us something to chew methodically as we march down the trail. That ticks all the jerky boxes in our field guide.

We tried the new options and picked the best for every jerky enthusiast, from the veggie curious to the hardcore vegan. Here are our favorites.

Fishpeople Lemon Zest and Herb Salmon Jerky

It's impossible to make a fish jerky that isn't, well, fishy. So we're going to suggest you have something potent--gum, toothpaste, a few wild mint leaves--to wipe the fish flavor from your mouth after the fact. That being said, Fishpeople's lemon zest and herb flavor tastes less like French kissing a merman than other iterations we've tried. It has a nice toothsome texture but is more tender than a traditional slab of dried beef flesh. Like all Fishpeople products, you can trace exactly where your wild-caught salmon came from by typing in a code on your package, a nice feature that keeps sustainable seafood companies honest. $8 per bag, available here.

Best For: Keto Hikers

Cocoburg Coconut Jerky

When you take your first bite, you will decry this being included in a jerky roundup: the texture is too firm--it's almost more like a firm cracker than a slice of dried meat. But stay with it. As you chew, the coconut flesh goes from hard to pliable. We promise you'll see why this totally counts as jerky. Even though I think of coconut as leaning toward the sweet side of things, the three flavors offered by Cocoburg live in the savory realm. This was the only product I tried where I liked the original flavor the best, though the ginger-teriyaki and chili-lime ones are pretty darn good, too. I had to put the bag in another room to stop myself from devouring all of it while I typed this up. $17 for a three-pack sampler, available here.

Best For: Sustainable Eaters

Akua Kelp Jerky

In case you haven't yet heard, kelp is the new kale: it's high in vitamins and minerals and has a negligible ecological footprint, requiring no feed, fertilizer, or fresh water. However, the downside is that kelp tastes remarkably like licking a barnacle. Fortunately, Akua has solved this problem by flavoring its kelp strips with seasonings that have enough backbone to stand up to that saltwater flavor. The maple and BBQ offering was my favorite, and while it doesn't completely mask the vegetal taste, it definitely helps. $20 for a three-bag sampler, available here.

Best For: Plant-Based Eaters

It's Jerky Y'all Prickly Pear Chipotle

Made from non-GMO soy, this had the best texture of the three soy jerkies I tried. Each serving has seven grams of plant-based protein, and a portion of every sale supports Rowdy Girl Sanctuary, a refuge for cattle run by vegans in Texas. All three flavors--black pepper and sea salt, prickly pear-teriyaki, and prickly pear-chipotle--are good, but my favorite was the sweet and smoky combo of prickly pear and chipotle. $21 for a three-pack sampler, available here.

Best For: The Jerky Adventurer

EntoLife Chirpy Jerky Original Roasted Cricket Jerky

To be fair, even though this is billed as a jerky, it's more of a crispy protein bark than anything else. Still, I'm including it because it's delicious and, with crickets in it, unique. A pemmican-style jerky, the recipe follows the Native American tradition of mixing protein and dried fruit together to make one nutrient-packed power food. It's nutty and sweet, and if no one ever told you otherwise, you'd never guess there were bugs in it. $6, available here.

Shrooms Splits Filet Mignon and Portabella Mushroom Jerky

Maybe you're not ready to dive fist first into a bag full of mushroom jerky. That's fine. (But if you are, Shrooms makes that, too.) This will meet you where you're at. A mix of soft beef slivers and dried mushrooms, it delivers tons of umami flavor. If you grab a handful at a time without looking closely, it can be hard to tell what's meat and what's 'shroom. Pretty soon you may find yourself graduating to nothing but a bag of fungi--like the company's teriyaki-mushroom-jerky offering. $7, available on Amazon.",8.0,0.3478260869565217,1.0,0.0434782608695652,6 Beef Jerky Alternatives That Are Actually Good,"We're not saying we have a beef with regular old jerky.

Chemicals used to cure beef jerky, salami, hot dogs, and other processed meat snacks may contribute to mania, an abnormal mood state characterized by hyperactivity, euphoria, and insomnia, according to a new study.

The study, which appears in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, while not designed to determine cause-and-effect, did find that people hospitalized for an episode of mania were three times more likely ever to have eaten nitrate-cured meats than were people without a history of a serious psychiatric disorder. Experiments in rats by the same researchers showed mania-like hyperactivity after just a few weeks on diets with added nitrates.

Mania, a state of elevated mood, arousal, and energy that lasts weeks to months, is generally seen in people with bipolar disorder.

While a number of genetic and other risk factors have been linked to manic episodes that characterize bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions, those factors have been unable to explain the cause of these illnesses. Researchers are increasingly looking for environmental factors, such as diet, that may play a role.

The new study adds to evidence that certain diets and potentially the amounts and types of bacteria in the gut may contribute to mania, the researchers say.

""Future work on this association could lead to dietary interventions to help reduce the risk of manic episodes in those who have bipolar disorder or who are otherwise vulnerable to mania,"" says Robert Yolken, professor of neurovirology in pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University.

Meat and mania

Mania, a state of elevated mood, arousal, and energy that lasts weeks to months, is generally seen in people with bipolar disorder, but can also occur in schizoaffective disorder. Manic states can lead to dangerous risk-taking behavior and can include delusional thinking. Most of those affected experience multiple hospitalizations.

""We looked at a number of different dietary exposures and cured meat really stood out.""

Bipolar disorder affects an estimated one to three percent of the US population and costs an estimated $25 billion a year in direct health care costs, according to a study in the Journal of Affective Disorders.

Yolken, trained as an infectious disease expert, was originally interested in whether exposure to infections such as viruses transmitted through food might be linked to psychiatric conditions. He and colleagues collected demographic, health, and dietary data on 1,101 individuals with and without psychiatric disorders.

Unexpectedly, among people who had been hospitalized for mania, the team found a history of eating cured meat before hospitalization 3.5 times higher than in the group of people without psychiatric illness. Cured meats were not associated with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder in people not hospitalized for mania, or in major depressive disorder. No other foods had a significant association with any of the disorders.

""We looked at a number of different dietary exposures and cured meat really stood out,"" Yolken says.

Nitrates have long been used as preservatives in cured meat products and have been previously linked to some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The dietary survey did not ask about frequency or time frame of cured meat consumption, so the researchers couldn't draw conclusions about how much cured meat may boost one's risk of mania, but Yolken hopes future studies will address this.

Altering rat brains

To get at the roots of the association, Yolken collaborated with researchers studying the impact of nitrates on rats.

They divided otherwise healthy rats into two groups: one received normal rat chow, and the other both normal chow and a piece of store-bought, nitrate-prepared beef jerky every other day. Within two weeks, the rats eating jerky showed irregular sleeping patterns and hyperactivity.

Next, the team worked with a Baltimore beef jerky company to create a special nitrate-free dried beef. They repeated the experiment, this time giving some rats the store-bought, nitrate-prepared jerky and others the nitrate-free formulation. The animals that ate the nitrate-free meat behaved similarly to a control group, while the animals that consumed the nitrates once again showed sleep disturbances and hyperactivity similar to that seen in mania.

The results were then replicated with a specially formulated rat chow that had either nitrate added directly to the chow, or no nitrate.

The amount of nitrate consumed on a daily basis by the rats--when scaled up to the size of a human--was equivalent to the amount a person might eat for a daily snack, such as one beef jerky stick or hot dog.

""We tried to make sure the amount of nitrate used in the experiment was in the range of what people might reasonably be eating,"" Yolken says.

When the group analyzed the gut bacteria of the rats, they found that animals with nitrate in their diet had different bacteria in their intestines than the others. The animals also had differences in several molecular pathways in the brain that have been previously implicated in bipolar disorder.

While occasional cured meat consumption is unlikely to spur a manic episode in most of the population, Yolken says the findings add to evidence that multiple factors contribute to mania and bipolar disorder.

Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Additional researchers contributing to the work came from Johns Hopkins, Sheppard Pratt Health System, Purdue University, and Mobtown Meat Snacks.

The dietary survey did not ask about frequency or time frame of cured meat consumption, so the researchers couldn't draw conclusions about how much cured meat may boost one's risk of mania, but Yolken hopes future studies will address this.

Altering rat brains

To get at the roots of the association, Yolken collaborated with researchers studying the impact of nitrates on rats.

They divided otherwise healthy rats into two groups: one received normal rat chow, and the other both normal chow and a piece of store-bought, nitrate-prepared beef jerky every other day. Within two weeks, the rats eating jerky showed irregular sleeping patterns and hyperactivity.

Next, the team worked with a Baltimore beef jerky company to create a special nitrate-free dried beef. They repeated the experiment, this time giving some rats the store-bought, nitrate-prepared jerky and others the nitrate-free formulation. The animals that ate the nitrate-free meat behaved similarly to a control group, while the animals that consumed the nitrates once again showed sleep disturbances and hyperactivity similar to that seen in mania.

The results were then replicated with a specially formulated rat chow that had either nitrate added directly to the chow, or no nitrate.

The amount of nitrate consumed on a daily basis by the rats--when scaled up to the size of a human--was equivalent to the amount a person might eat for a daily snack, such as one beef jerky stick or hot dog.

""We tried to make sure the amount of nitrate used in the experiment was in the range of what people might reasonably be eating,"" Yolken says.

When the group analyzed the gut bacteria of the rats, they found that animals with nitrate in their diet had different bacteria in their intestines than the others. The animals also had differences in several molecular pathways in the brain that have been previously implicated in bipolar disorder.

While occasional cured meat consumption is unlikely to spur a manic episode in most of the population, Yolken says the findings add to evidence that multiple factors contribute to mania and bipolar disorder.

Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Additional researchers contributing to the work came from Johns Hopkins, Sheppard Pratt Health System, Purdue University, and Mobtown Meat Snacks.

Researchers from 21 countries, who published their findings last week in the journal The Lancet, found that it's only a risk if someone eats more than 5 grams of sodium a day, the equivalent of 2.5 teaspoons of salt. And even if that amount is exceeded, any health risk can be virtually eliminated with the addition of fruits, vegetables, dairy foods, potatoes and other potassium-rich foods.

""There is no convincing evidence that people with moderate or average sodium intake need to reduce their sodium intake for prevention of heart disease and stroke,"" co-author Dr. Martin O'Donnell, a researchers at the Population Health Research Institute of McMaster University and associate professor at Hamilton Health Sciences in Canada, said in a press release.

The American Heart Association recommends 1.5 grams of sodium a day for most adults and no more than 2.3 grams a day.

In the study, China was the only country where 80 percent of communities have a sodium intake of more than 5 grams a day. Elsewhere, the majority of the communities had an average sodium consumption of 3 to 5 grams a day.

""The World Health Organization recommends consumption of less than 2 grams of sodium -- that's 1 teaspoon of salt -- a day as a preventative measure against cardiovascular disease, but there is little evidence in terms of improved health outcomes that individuals ever achieve at such a low level,"" first author Dr. Andrew Mente, a PHRI researcher, said.

The study is one ",,1,"Study findings have wavered in their verdicts on high- and low-carbohydrate diets, but new research suggests that moderate carbohydrate consumption may be better than either extreme. The study is one of several in recent weeks to take aim at the once-popular idea that low carb should supplant low fat as the most heart-healthy diet.In a new cohort study following 15,000 US adults for a median of 25 years, high- and low-carbohydrate diets each were tied to an increased risk of mortality. By contrast, diets based in plant-based proteins and fats had a lower risk of death.Though low-carbohydrate diets are associated with short-term weight loss, the long-term health impacts of these diets are not as well known, write Sara Seidelmann, MD, PhD (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), and colleagues.""Although many randomized controlled trials of low-carbohydrate diets suggest beneficial short-term weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk, morality risk has typically not been investigated in light of the practical challenges posed by studies involving very long durations of follow-up,"" they say.The study was published online in Lancet Public Health earlier this month.ARICResearchers selected 15,428 adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk of Communities (ARIC) study who were enrolled between 1987 and 1989. All included participants completed a questionnaire documenting food intake that researchers could then use to calculate the percent of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that a subject regularly ate.The study followed participants until 2013, looking carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality. A moderate carbohydrate intake of 50-55% of daily energy intake was used as the reference point. There were 6,283 deaths in ARIC during follow-up.After for adjusting for potentially confounding factors such age, race, gender, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and physical activity, the study found that ARIC individuals who fell into the lowest range of carbohydrate intake (< 30% of total energy) were 37% more likely to suffer from all-cause mortality than the group of moderate carbohydrate intake (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.13-1.63). Individuals with the highest carbohydrate intake (> 70%) were 16% more likely to die than the reference group (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02-1.33).The graph of these hazard ratios formed a U-shape, with moderate carbohydrate consumption associated with the lowest risk.Seidelmann et al later combined the ARIC data with seven multinational prospective studies for a meta-analysis of 432,179 patients and a total of 40,181 deaths. The pooled analysis had similar findings. Low-carbohydrate diets were associated with a 20% greater risk of death compared to diets with moderate carbohydrate consumption (pooled HR 1.20; 1.09-1.32), and high-carb diets increased risk of death by 23% (pooled HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.11-1.36).Eat Carbs in ModerationThis U-shape, where either end of the spectrum resulted in higher risk, is reasonable, says Andrew Mente, PhD (Population Health Research Institute, Ontario, Canada). ""It is really not all that surprising to say that there is sweet spot-no pun intended-in the middle for carbohydrates,"" he said, ""because that would suggest that a moderate diet is optimal.

",,,,,Both High- and Low-Carb Diets Increase Long-term Risk of Mortality: ARIC Analysis,"Study findings have wavered in their verdicts on high- and low-carbohydrate diets, but new research suggests that moderate carbohydrate consumption may be better than either extreme. The study is one of several in recent weeks to take aim at the once-popular idea that low carb should supplant low fat as the most heart-healthy diet.In a new cohort study following 15,000 US adults for a median of 25 years, high- and low-carbohydrate diets each were tied to an increased risk of mortality. By contrast, diets based in plant-based proteins and fats had a lower risk of death.Though low-carbohydrate diets are associated with short-term weight loss, the long-term health impacts of these diets are not as well known, write Sara Seidelmann, MD, PhD (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), and colleagues.""Although many randomized controlled trials of low-carbohydrate diets suggest beneficial short-term weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk, morality risk has typically not been investigated in light of the practical challenges posed by studies involving very long durations of follow-up,"" they say.The study was published online in Lancet Public Health earlier this month.ARICResearchers selected 15,428 adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk of Communities (ARIC) study who were enrolled between 1987 and 1989. All included participants completed a questionnaire documenting food intake that researchers could then use to calculate the percent of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that a subject regularly ate.The study followed participants until 2013, looking carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality. A moderate carbohydrate intake of 50-55% of daily energy intake was used as the reference point. There were 6,283 deaths in ARIC during follow-up.After for adjusting for potentially confounding factors such age, race, gender, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and physical activity, the study found that ARIC individuals who fell into the lowest range of carbohydrate intake (< 30% of total energy) were 37% more likely to suffer from all-cause mortality than the group of moderate carbohydrate intake (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.13-1.63). Individuals with the highest carbohydrate intake (> 70%) were 16% more likely to die than the reference group (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02-1.33).The graph of these hazard ratios formed a U-shape, with moderate carbohydrate consumption associated with the lowest risk.Seidelmann et al later combined the ARIC data with seven multinational prospective studies for a meta-analysis of 432,179 patients and a total of 40,181 deaths. The pooled analysis had similar findings. Low-carbohydrate diets were associated with a 20% greater risk of death compared to diets with moderate carbohydrate consumption (pooled HR 1.20; 1.09-1.32), and high-carb diets increased risk of death by 23% (pooled HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.11-1.36).Eat Carbs in ModerationThis U-shape, where either end of the spectrum resulted in higher risk, is reasonable, says Andrew Mente, PhD (Population Health Research Institute, Ontario, Canada). ""It is really not all that surprising to say that there is sweet spot-no pun intended-in the middle for carbohydrates,"" he said, ""because that would suggest that a moderate diet is optimal.

With data from NASA's Cassini and Huygens missions, scientists have uncovered a chemical trail that suggests prebiotic conditions may exist on Saturn's moon Titan.

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, features terrain with Earthlike attributes such as lakes, rivers, and seas, although filled with liquid methane and ethane instead of water. Its dense atmosphere--a yellow haze--brims with nitrogen and methane. When sunlight hits this toxic atmosphere, the reaction produces hydrogen cyanide--a possible prebiotic chemical key.

""This paper is a starting point, as we are looking for prebiotic chemistry in conditions other than Earth's,"" says Martin Rahm, postdoctoral researcher in chemistry at Cornell University and lead author of the new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To grasp the blueprint of early planetary life, Rahm says we must think outside of green-blue, Earth-based biology: ""We are used to our own conditions here on Earth. Our scientific experience is at room temperature and ambient conditions. Titan is a completely different beast."" Although Earth and Titan both have flowing liquids, Titan's temperatures are very low, and there is no liquid water. ""So if we think in biological terms, we're probably going to be at a dead end,"" he says.

Hydrogen cyanide is an organic chemical that can react with itself or with other molecules--forming long chains, or polymers, one of which is called polyimine (pronounced poly-ee-meen). Polyimine is flexible, which helps mobility under very cold conditions, and it can absorb the sun's energy and become a possible catalyst for life.

""Polyimine can exist as different structures, and they may be able to accomplish remarkable things at low temperatures, especially under Titan's conditions,"" says Rahm, who works in the lab of Roald Hoffmann, professor emeritus and winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Rahm and the paper's other scientists consulted with Hoffmann on this work.

""We need to continue to examine this, to understand how the chemistry evolves over time. We see this as a preparation for further exploration,"" says Rahm. ""If future observations could show there is prebiotic chemistry in a place like Titan, it would be a major breakthrough. This paper is indicating that prerequisites for processes leading to a different kind of life could exist on Titan, but this only the first step.""

With data from NASA's Cassini and Huygens missions, scientists have uncovered a chemical trail that suggests prebiotic conditions may exist on Saturn's moon Titan.

""Our scientific experience is at room temperature and ambient conditions. Titan is a completely different beast.""

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, features terrain with Earthlike attributes such as lakes, rivers, and seas, although filled with liquid methane and ethane instead of water. Its dense atmosphere--a yellow haze--brims with nitrogen and methane. When sunlight hits this toxic atmosphere, the reaction produces hydrogen cyanide--a possible prebiotic chemical key.

""This paper is a starting point, as we are looking for prebiotic chemistry in conditions other than Earth's,"" says Martin Rahm, postdoctoral researcher in chemistry at Cornell University and lead author of the new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To grasp the blueprint of early planetary life, Rahm says we must think outside of green-blue, Earth-based biology: ""We are used to our own conditions here on Earth. Our scientific experience is at room temperature and ambient conditions. Titan is a completely different beast."" Although Earth and Titan both have flowing liquids, Titan's temperatures are very low, and there is no liquid water. ""So if we think in biological terms, we're probably going to be at a dead end,"" he says.

Hydrogen cyanide is an organic chemical that can react with itself or with other molecules--forming long chains, or polymers, one of which is called polyimine (pronounced poly-ee-meen). Polyimine is flexible, which helps mobility under very cold conditions, and it can absorb the sun's energy and become a possible catalyst for life.

""Polyimine can exist as different structures, and they may be able to accomplish remarkable things at low temperatures, especially under Titan's conditions,"" says Rahm, who works in the lab of Roald Hoffmann, professor emeritus and winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Rahm and the paper's other scientists consulted with Hoffmann on this work.

""We need to continue to examine this, to understand how the chemistry evolves over time. We see this as a preparation for further exploration,"" says Rahm. ""If future observations could show there is prebiotic chemistry in a place like Titan, it would be a major breakthrough. This paper is indicating that prerequisites for processes leading to a different kind of life could exist on Titan, but this only the first step.""

There have been a lot of theories suggesting that the most conducive to life are Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon, Titan. But today, astronomers and scientists are looking more closely at Titan since a study was conducted and it was revealed that the chemical composition found on Saturn's moon might indeed breed life.

Titan, as the name suggests, is Saturn's second largest moon. NASA considered it as one of the Earth-like bodies due to its dense atmosphere and river-like structures full of methane. But the gravity on Titan is said to be weaker than the moon.

The recent study that supports the claim of Titan's chemical properties was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study suggests that the prebiotic chemical conditions in Titan are the same chemicals found on Earth able to build life.

""So if we think in biological terms, we're probably going to be at a dead end,"" Rahm added.

Hydrogen Cyanide was found in the atmosphere of Titan that can produce polyimine. Polyimine can shift to a form that enables the atmosphere to absorb light and energy to pass through despite the cold, according to ScienceRecorder.

Titan is too cold for liquid water to exist, but if polyimine found on its atmosphere could indeed allow light to pass through, then it's a different story. This prompted researchers to look at life-giving chemical reactions that can potentially host life on Titan. ""We are postulating that the polymers form on the surface of Titan from hydrogen cyanide that has sedimented out after being made in the atmosphere,"" Professor Jonathan Lunine from Cornell University in New York said in an interview with Daily Mail.

""We are used to our own conditions here on Earth. Our scientific experience is at room temperature and ambient conditions. Titan is a completely different beast,"" Martin Rahm, author of the new study said in a statement published by Washington Post. ""So if we think in biological terms, we're probably going to be at a dead end,"" Rahm added.

Hydrogen Cyanide was found in the atmosphere of Titan that can produce polyimine. Polyimine can shift to a form that enables the atmosphere to absorb light and energy to pass through despite the cold, according to ScienceRecorder.

Titan is too cold for liquid water to exist, but if polyimine found on its atmosphere could indeed allow light to pass through, then it's a different story. This prompted researchers to look at life-giving chemical reactions that can potentially host life on Titan. ""We are postulating that the polymers form on the surface of Titan from hydrogen cyanide that has sedimented out after being made in the atmosphere,"" Professor Jonathan Lunine from Cornell University in New York said in an interview with Daily Mail.

""I suspect that if we were to blow them up to 20 times their size, we'd consider some of them to be the most beautiful fish on the reef,"" he says.

The small size of these fish also limits how many eggs they can produce, ""which means they have to be extremely religious about making sure those actually hatch,"" Brandl says.

When researchers count the baby fish in the waters near a reef, about 70 percent will be cryptobenthics.

For most of these larvae, life will be brief--even if they escape the jaws of predators. The pygmy goby, for example, crams its entire existence into just two months--the shortest life span of any backboned animal. Much of that time is spent as a larva, which quickly quintuples in size into an inch-long adult that lasts for just a few weeks. Living fast and dying young: That's the cryptobenthic way. ""They've broken with the fundamental rule of being a vertebrate, which is that you spend most of your time as an adult,"" says Brandl. ""They're almost getting into mayfly territory.""

All of this explains why standard surveys fail to capture how important these fish are. Ecologists typically study reef animals by measuring their ""standing biomass""--that is, they grab all the adults in an area and weigh them. By this measure, cryptobenthics seem unimportant: Though there are plenty of them, they barely shift the scales, even together. But that metric is profoundly misleading, because it ignores just how many cryptobenthics are eaten, and how often they're eaten.

By simulating the lives of these fishes, Brandl found that their generations tick by so quickly, and they're so frequently preyed upon, that every individual is replaced seven times a year. That's a huge mass of fish that we rarely ever notice, because it's eaten almost as quickly as it is generated. Weigh the survivors at any one moment, and you'll be unimpressed. But estimate the total mass of the dead, as Brandl and his team did, and you'll find that cryptobenthics account for 60 percent of the fish flesh that is eaten on a reef.

As larvae, they feed in richer offshore waters before moving back to the reefs once they mature.

Researchers from Simon Fraser University have discovered how coral reefs support such an abundance and diversity of life. Banting Postdoctoral Fellow Simon Brandl and a team of international researchers revealed that tiny fish species around the world fuel life on coral reefs.



The research, published in Science, examines how commonly overlooked 'cryptobenthic' fishes--tiny, bottom-dwelling creatures--are a bountiful food source for larger fishes.



""These fish are like candy,"" says Brandl. ""They are tiny, colorful bundles of energy that get eaten almost immediately by any coral reef organism that can bite, grab or slurp them up.

Millions of people depend on them for food. What accounts for their dazzling productivity?

Ever since Charles Darwin first recognized the paradox, scientists have struggled to resolve it. One theory suggests that the sloping topography of reefs captures and concentrates nutrients and microscopic plankton from the surrounding waters. Another focuses on the role of sponges and other invertebrates in recycling dead organic matter into something that can be eaten.

Now, marine scientists from Canada, France, Australia, and the U.S. believe they have found another part of the solution to Darwinas paradox. In a paper published this week in Science, they argue that a plethora of tiny reef fishesathe oceanas smallest vertebratesaare fuelling the nutritional engine of reef ecosystems, providing food for the larger and more eye-catching creatures.

Those puny fishesagobies, blennies, cardinalfishes, and othersaare mostly less than two inches long. Some are so tiny you would need 40 of them to equal the weight of a quarter. Yet they may account for almost 60 percent of the fish biomass and half the fish species on a reefaathe hidden half,a says Simon Brandl, a coral reef ecologist at Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver, who led the new study.

The secret of the tiny fishesa successaand of their importance on the reefais a way of life that is reminiscent of insects: They breed prolifically, grow fast, and lead very short lives.

aThey have made a switch that is unlike any vertebrate organism we know,a Brandl says. aThey have gone into mayfly territory, cicada territory, with a long larval stage and only a few weeks as adults. They reproduce, and then theyare gone, gobbled up by a predator.a

Crimson and key-lime camouflage

The formal name for these neglected animals is acryptobenthic reef fishesa: aCryptoa because they blend into their environment, either visually or by their behavior, and abenthica because they live near, or even within, the seabed.

Blending in on a coral reef often requires gaudy coloring. Cryptobenthics may be crimson with turquoise spots, scarlet with yellow stripes, key-lime green, pewter dipped in orange, mango dipped in purple. They have spots, speckles, racing stripes, vertical bars, and hallucinogenic swashes. There are endless variations.

In keeping with their diminutive size, many of these fish occupy territories only a few handas breadths in size, and they have highly specific habitat preferences. Some live only on a single species of coral. Others live only on sand, or on rubble, or in empty worm tubes.

Scientists have so far discovered more than 2,800 species of these fishes, and are finding new ones at the rate of about 30 a year. Sometimes they have to use chemical anesthetics to flush the tiny fish from their lairs.

With manned submersibles, biologists have even found new cryptobenthics on reefs many hundreds of feet deepaa process Brandl compares to asearching for a needle in a haystack in a dark barn using a forklift.a

Short lives, excellent parenting

The great significance of these fish, says Brandl, is their way of life. Their fast growth, rapid turnover, and extreme mortality serve as a pump that constantly keeps biological energy flowing through the reef food web. The cryptobenthics eat microscopic stuffafilamentous algae, coral mucus, tiny crustaceansaand convert it to food for the hundreds of large fish species that define coral reefs in the minds of those who treasure them.

The turnover of the tiny fish is immense. The maximum age of the dwarf goby in the wild is 59 daysathe shortest lifespan of any known vertebrate. Another goby spends longer as a larval stage than as an adult. No other fish is known to have that life pattern.

Up to 70 percent of cryptobenthics die each week, according to Brandlas team, mostly in the jaws of bigger animals. They are eaten by virtually any reef predatorafish, mantis shrimps, crabs, even some predatory mollusks. The diet of juvenile groupers has been found to consist of almost 90 percent cryptobenthic fish.

To keep up, the tiny fish breed very fast, and year-round; dwarf gobies, for instance, can produce more than seven generations in a year. More important, cryptobenthics are very successful at ensuring that their offspring survive.

Most larger fish broadcast their eggs into the sea and let currents spread them far and wideaa hedging strategy that ensures there will always be a few larvae floating around to replenish a population if a disaster strikes. aThe disadvantage is you have to produce a huge number of offspring in order for some to survive the death trap of the open ocean,a Brandl says.

Cryptobenthic reef fish have the opposite strategy: They produce fewer offspring, keep them close to home, and invest heavily in them by providing an unusual degree of parental care.

Some brood their eggs in a pouch, some in their mouths, some tuck them behind their pectoral finsathatas called armpit brooding. Two groups give birth to live youngaa rarity among coral reef fishes.

Even species with more conventional egg-laying approaches, where the female attaches a sticky egg mass to a coral branch, a sponge, or a rock, provide those eggs with postnatal care. Itas mostly males who perform egg-minding duties, which include fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated, and cleaning them to prevent the build up of detritus. Some species may even provide the eggs with antibiotic protection against infection.

Furtive childhood

All this parental investment would be of little avail if the larvae were swept away from the reef by strong currents. Whereas the larvae of large fish actively seek out those currents, to kick-start their ocean wanderings, cryptobenthic reef-fish larvae avoid them, settling on their home reef.

They manage to linger at the periphery of reefs, somehow keeping clear of both reef-based and open-ocean predators.",18.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.037037037037037,Coral reefs depend on lots of fish the size of jellybeans,"Thereas an old paradox about coral reefs: They occupy tiny parts of the ocean, and nutrient-poor parts of it at that, and yet theyare home to a third of the worldas fish species.

Up to 70 percent of cryptobenthics die each week, according to Brandlas team, mostly in the jaws of bigger animals. They are eaten by virtually any reef predatorafish, mantis shrimps, crabs, even some predatory mollusks. The diet of juvenile groupers has been found to consist of almost 90 percent cryptobenthic fish.

To keep up, the tiny fish breed very fast, and year-round; dwarf gobies, for instance, can produce more than seven generations in a year. More important, cryptobenthics are very successful at ensuring that their offspring survive.

Most larger fish broadcast their eggs into the sea and let currents spread them far and wideaa hedging strategy that ensures there will always be a few larvae floating around to replenish a population if a disaster strikes. aThe disadvantage is you have to produce a huge number of offspring in order for some to survive the death trap of the open ocean,a Brandl says.

Cryptobenthic reef fish have the opposite strategy: They produce fewer offspring, keep them close to home, and invest heavily in them by providing an unusual degree of parental care.

Some brood their eggs in a pouch, some in their mouths, some tuck them behind their pectoral finsathatas called armpit brooding. Two groups give birth to live youngaa rarity among coral reef fishes.

Even species with more conventional egg-laying approaches, where the female attaches a sticky egg mass to a coral branch, a sponge, or a rock, provide those eggs with postnatal care. Itas mostly males who perform egg-minding duties, which include fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated, and cleaning them to prevent the build up of detritus. Some species may even provide the eggs with antibiotic protection against infection.

Furtive childhood

All this parental investment would be of little avail if the larvae were swept away from the reef by strong currents. Whereas the larvae of large fish actively seek out those currents, to kick-start their ocean wanderings, cryptobenthic reef-fish larvae avoid them, settling on their home reef.

Cryptobenthics may be crimson with turquoise spots, scarlet with yellow stripes, key-lime green, pewter dipped in orange, mango dipped in purple. They have spots, speckles, racing stripes, vertical bars, and hallucinogenic swashes.

They descri,0.6,1,"Newswise -- Researchers from the University of Tokyo have revamped an old e-paper concept to make an inexpensive handwriting-enabled e-paper well suited to large displays like whiteboards. They describe the e-paper in the Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing.

Traditional ink and paper is convenient for both reading and writing. In e-paper development the writing feature has generally lagged behind. Handwriting-enabled displays mainly show up in the inexpensive, but feature-limited realm of children's toys, and in the high-end realm of touch-screen e-readers and smart pens.

A team of Japanese researchers has now taken an e-paper technology originally developed in the 1970s and updated it to make a tough and inexpensive display that could be used like a whiteboard when a large writing space is required.

The display is made from bicolored microparticles about 0.1 millimeters in diameter. One hemisphere of each particle is black and carries a negative charge, while the other is white and carries a positive charge. The particles are sandwiched between two electrodes. By switching the direction of the voltage across the electrodes the background display can be switched between black and white.

Such ""twisting ball"" displays are not new, but the researchers were the first to integrate a magnetic field control component with the original electric control. In addition to carrying a negative charge, the black side of the microparticles also contains magnetic nanoparticles that make it possible to write on the screen.

A magnet pulled across the surface of the white display attracts the black side and the balls flip to face the magnet. In this way images and lines can be drawn on the display. A magnet with about the strength of a refrigerator magnet will work for this task.

Applying a voltage will immediately erase the drawings. In the absence of a voltage or magnetic field, the image is maintained without using any energy.

""Toughness, cost, size and color are the advantages of our e-paper display,"" said Yusuke Komazaki, a researcher in the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences at the University of Tokyo and lead author on the paper. The display is made from materials like acrylic polymer, silicone elastomer, and silicone oil that are relatively inexpensive and hold up well under UV light. Because of the e-paper's simple structure, large displays can be easily fabricated, Komazaki said. In addition, the researchers could easily change the color combinations by substituting different microparticle pigments, he said.

The researchers believe low-cost, lightweight, and energy-saving electronic whiteboards are a suitable application for the new e-paper. ""Conventional electronic whiteboards are equipped with large LCDs or projectors and are very expensive, less visible in bright light conditions, heavy, and energy consuming,"" Komazaki said, so the new displays could have many competitive advantages.

""If we fabricate super-large displays, it might even be possible to replace traditional blackboards in classrooms,"" Komazaki said.

The team is working to improve the contrast of the display, which they believe can be achieved by increasing the amount of black and white pigment in the microparticles.

Eventually, the researchers believe their work could contribute to a world that is much less dependent on traditional paper.

""Writing and drawing is an indispensable feature of paper, so we believe that our handwriting-enabled e-paper is closer to real paper than conventional e-papers,"" said Komazaki. ""Someday, handwriting-enabled e-paper may replace real paper.""

Almost half of active-duty military members in the ",0.4285714285714285,1,"Alcohol abuse is pervasive in the military, where a culture of heavy drinking and the stress of deployment lead many soldiers down a troubled path.

Almost half of active-duty military members in the United States -- 47 percent -- were binge-drinkers in 2008, up from 35 percent a decade earlier. Rates of heavy drinking also rose during that period, according to a 2012 report by the Institute of Medicine. But many in the military avoid seeking help for alcohol abuse, fearing disciplinary action or other repercussions, and few soldiers are referred for evaluation or treatment.

""If you're in the military and you seek substance abuse treatment, your commanding officer is notified and it goes on your medical record and your military record. That's a huge barrier,"" said Denise Walker, director of the Innovative Programs Research Group at the University of Washington School of Social Work.

Not surprisingly, there is little research on what type of treatment is most effective for active-duty military members. To shed new insight on that question and remove obstacles to seeking treatment, Walker and a team of researchers tested a telephone-based intervention geared specifically to military members struggling with alcohol abuse -- with promising results.

The study, published online Oct. 13 in October in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, found that participants in the telephone intervention significantly reduced their drinking over time, had lower rates of alcohol dependence and were more likely to seek treatment.

The trial involved 242 military members at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in western Washington, who were recruited through advertisements and informational booths at military events. All met the criteria for alcohol use disorder, though none were enrolled in treatment programs.

Participants had an initial interview by phone to assess their daily and monthly alcohol consumption. They were also asked a series of questions about the consequences of their drinking -- for example, whether it had impacted their physical training or interfered with their ability to fulfill their duties.

Then participants were randomized to a treatment or control group. The control group received educational information about alcohol and other drug use, while the treatment group got a one-hour personalized intervention session over the phone that used ""motivational interviewing,"" a goal-oriented approach intended to help people make positive behavioral changes.

""The intervention really connects their behavior with their values and goals and wants for themselves,"" Walker said. ""It's a safe place to talk confidentially and freely with someone on the other end who is compassionate and non-judgmental.""

The counselors also asked participants about their alcohol consumption versus that of their peers, to gauge whether excessive drinking was in part spurred by normative perceptions about alcohol use in the military.

""The army has a culture of drinking, so there's a heightened sense among soldiers that their peers are drinking more than they actually are,"" said Thomas Walton, project director for the study and a UW doctoral student in social work.

""When those perceptions are corrected, it can have a strong effect, as heavy-drinking soldiers often reduce their intake to more typical levels.""

Follow-up interviews were conducted three and six months after the sessions and showed significant decreases in both drinking rates and alcohol dependence. Intervention group participants went from drinking 32 drinks weekly on average to 14 drinks weekly after six months, and their rates of alcohol dependence dropped from 83 to 22 percent. Alcohol dependence also decreased in the control group, from 83 to 35 percent.

""Those are pretty dramatic reductions in drinking, particularly for one session with a counselor,"" Walker said. ""That was really encouraging.""

Participants increasingly sought treatment over time; by the six-month follow-up, nearly one-third of soldiers in both groups had made some move toward seeking treatment, such as discussing substance abuse concerns with an army chaplain or making an appointment for treatment intake. While the intervention led to more dramatic decreases in drinking, providing educational information may be enough to prompt some to take a first step toward making a change, the researchers said.

Walker and Walton attribute the intervention's success to its convenience and confidentiality. Participants could enroll without fear of their superiors finding out -- recruitment materials made it clear that military command was not involved -- and could schedule the phone calls at their convenience.

""Some did the session on their lunch breaks or in the garage while their family was in the house,"" Walker said. ""They didn't have to walk into a building that says 'army substance abuse program.' It was private and a low-burden intervention.""

And though the military offers substance abuse programs, Walker said, many soldiers avoid seeking help and are not referred to treatment until their problems reach a crisis point.

""People who get into army substance abuse programs are often mandated to go or have gotten into trouble,"" she said. ""That leaves out a huge proportion of the population who are struggling and not doing well.""

That reality and the protracted conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Walker said, have intensified the need for additional options to help soldiers grappling with substance abuse and other problems. Telephone-based counseling, she said, is a cost-effective way to encourage military members to seek help confidentially, without the barriers of more traditional approaches.

""This intervention has the potential to be used for soldiers and military personnel worldwide. It would really help fill the gap in service provision that is currently available to soldiers.""

(Nanowerk News) The chemical secrets of a concrete Roman breakwater that has spent the last 2,000 years submerged in the Mediterranean Sea have been uncovered by an international team of researchers led by Paulo Monteiro of the U.S. Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.

Analysis of samples provided by team member Marie Jackson pinpointed why the best Roman concrete was superior to most modern concrete in durability, why its manufacture was less environmentally damaging  and how these improvements could be adopted in the modern world.

Its not that modern concrete isnt good  its so good we use 19 billion tons of it a year, says Monteiro. The problem is that manufacturing Portland cement accounts for seven percent of the carbon dioxide that industry puts into the air.

Portland cement is the source of the glue that holds most modern concrete together. But making it releases carbon from burning fuel, needed to heat a mix of limestone and clays to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,642 degrees Fahrenheit)  and from the heated limestone (calcium carbonate) itself. Monteiros team found that the Romans, by contrast, used much less lime and made it from limestone baked at 900degC (1,652degF) or lower, requiring far less fuel than Portland cement.

Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is one powerful incentive for finding a better way to provide the concrete the world needs; another is the need for stronger, longer-lasting buildings, bridges, and other structures.

In the middle 20th century, concrete structures were designed to last 50 years, and a lot of them are on borrowed time, Monteiro says. Now we design buildings to last 100 to 120 years. Yet Roman harbor installations have survived 2,000 years of chemical attack and wave action underwater.

Drill core of volcanic ash-hydrated lime mortar from the ancient port of Baiae in Pozzuloi Bay. Yellowish inclusions are pumice, dark stony fragments are lava, gray areas consist of other volcanic crystalline materials, and white spots are lime. Inset is a scanning electron microscope image of the special Al-tobermorite crystals that are key to the superior quality of Roman seawater concrete.

How the Romans did it

The Romans made concrete by mixing lime and volcanic rock. For underwater structures, lime and volcanic ash were mixed to form mortar, and this mortar and volcanic tuff were packed into wooden forms. The seawater instantly triggered a hot chemical reaction. The lime was hydrated  incorporating water molecules into its structure  and reacted with the ash to cement the whole mixture together.

Descriptions of volcanic ash have survived from ancient times. First Vitruvius, an engineer for the Emperor Augustus, and later Pliny the Elder recorded that the best maritime concrete was made with ash from volcanic regions of the Gulf of Naples (Pliny died in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius that buried Pompeii), especially from sites near todays seaside town of Pozzuoli. Ash with similar mineral characteristics, called pozzolan, is found in many parts of the world.

Using beamlines 5.3.2.1, 5.3.2.2, 12.2.2 and 12.3.2 at Berkeley Labs Advanced Light Source (ALS), along with other experimental facilities at UC Berkeley, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, and the BESSY synchrotron in Germany, Monteiro and his colleagues investigated maritime concrete from Pozzuoli Bay. They found that Roman concrete differs from the modern kind in several essential ways.

One is the kind of glue that binds the concretes components together. In concrete made with Portland cement this is a compound of calcium, silicates, and hydrates (C-S-H). Roman concrete produces a significantly different compound, with added aluminum and less silicon. The resulting calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) is an exceptionally stable binder.

At ALS beamlines 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2, x-ray spectroscopy showed that the specific way the aluminum substitutes for silicon in the C-A-S-H may be the key to the cohesion and stability of the seawater concrete.

Another striking contribution of the Monteiro team concerns the hydration products in concrete. In theory, C-S-H in concrete made with Portland cement resembles a combination of naturally occurring layered minerals, called tobermorite and jennite. Unfortunately these ideal crystalline structures are nowhere to be found in conventional modern concrete.

Tobermorite does occur in the mortar of ancient seawater concrete, however. High-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments at ALS beamline 12.2.2 measured its mechanical properties and, for the first time, clarified the role of aluminum in its crystal lattice. Al-tobermorite (Al for aluminum) has a greater stiffness than poorly crystalline C-A-S-H and provides a model for concrete strength and durability in the future.

Finally, microscopic studies at ALS beamline 12.3.2 identified the other minerals in the Roman samples. Integration of the results from the various beamlines revealed the minerals potential applications for high-performance concretes, including the encapsulation of hazardous wastes.

Lessons for the future

Environmentally friendly modern concretes already include volcanic ash or fly ash from coal-burning power plants as partial substitutes for Portland cement, with good results. These blended cements also produce C-A-S-H, but their long-term performance could not be determined until the Monteiro team analyzed Roman concrete.

Their analyses showed that the Roman recipe needed less than 10 percent lime by weight, made at two-thirds or less the temperature required by Portland cement. Lime reacting with aluminum-rich pozzolan ash and seawater formed highly stable C-A-S-H and Al-tobermorite, insuring strength and longevity. Both the materials and the way the Romans used them hold lessons for the future.

For us, pozzolan is important for its practical applications, says Monteiro. It could replace 40 percent of the worlds demand for Portland cement. And there are sources of pozzolan all over the world. Saudi Arabia doesnt have any fly ash, but it has mountains of pozzolan.

Stronger, longer-lasting modern concrete, made with less fuel and less release of carbon into the atmosphere, may be the legacy of a deeper understanding of how the Romans made their incomparable concrete.

(Nanowerk News) The chemical secrets of a concrete Roman breakwater that has spent the last 2,000 years submerged in the Mediterranean Sea have been uncovered by an international team of researchers led by Paulo Monteiro of the U.S. Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.

Analysis of samples provided by team member Marie Jackson pinpointed why the best Roman concrete was superior to most modern concrete in durability, why its manufacture was less environmentally damaging  and how these improvements could be adopted in the modern world.

Its not that modern concrete isnt good  its so good we use 19 billion tons of it a year, says Monteiro. The problem is that manufacturing Portland cement accounts for seven percent of the carbon dioxide that industry puts into the air.

Portland cement is the source of the glue that holds most modern concrete together. But making it releases carbon from burning fuel, needed to heat a mix of limestone and clays to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,642 degrees Fahrenheit)  and from the heated limestone (calcium carbonate) itself. Monteiros team found that the Romans, by contrast, used much less lime and made it from limestone baked at 900degC (1,652degF) or lower, requiring far less fuel than Portland cement.

Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is one powerful incentive for finding a better way to provide the concrete the world needs; another is the need for stronger, longer-lasting buildings, bridges, and other structures.

In the middle 20th century, concrete structures were designed to last 50 years, and a lot of them are on borrowed time, Monteiro says. Now we design buildings to last 100 to 120 years. Yet Roman harbor installations have survived 2,000 years of chemical attack and wave action underwater.

How the Romans did it

The Romans made concrete by mixing lime and volcanic rock. For underwater structures, lime and volcanic ash were mixed to form mortar, and this mortar and volcanic tuff were packed into wooden forms. The seawater instantly triggered a hot chemical reaction. The lime was hydrated  incorporating water molecules into its structure  and reacted with the ash to cement the whole mixture together.

Descriptions of volcanic ash have survived from ancient times. First Vitruvius, an engineer for the Emperor Augustus, and later Pliny the Elder recorded that the best maritime concrete was made with ash from volcanic regions of the Gulf of Naples (Pliny died in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius that buried Pompeii), especially from sites near todays seaside town of Pozzuoli. Ash with similar mineral characteristics, called pozzolan, is found in many parts of the world.

Using beamlines 5.3.2.1, 5.3.2.2, 12.2.2 and 12.3.2 at Berkeley Labs Advanced Light Source (ALS), along with other experimental facilities at UC Berkeley, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, and the BESSY synchrotron in Germany, Monteiro and his colleagues investigated maritime concrete from Pozzuoli Bay. They found that Roman concrete differs from the modern kind in several essential ways.

One is the kind of glue that binds the concretes components together. In concrete made with Portland cement this is a compound of calcium, silicates, and hydrates (C-S-H). Roman concrete produces a significantly different compound, with added aluminum and less silicon. The resulting calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) is an exceptionally stable binder.

At ALS beamlines 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2, x-ray spectroscopy showed that the specific way the aluminum substitutes for silicon in the C-A-S-H may be the key to the cohesion and stability of the seawater concrete.

Another striking contribution of the Monteiro team concerns the hydration products in concrete. In theory, C-S-H in concrete made with Portland cement resembles a combination of naturally occurring layered minerals, called tobermorite and jennite. Unfortunately these ideal crystalline structures are nowhere to be found in conventional modern concrete.

Tobermorite does occur in the mortar of ancient seawater concrete, however. High-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments at ALS beamline 12.2.2 measured its mechanical properties and, for the first time, clarified the role of aluminum in its crystal lattice. Al-tobermorite (Al for aluminum) has a greater stiffness than poorly crystalline C-A-S-H and provides a model for concrete strength and durability in the future.

Finally, microscopic studies at ALS beamline 12.3.2 identified the other minerals in the Roman samples. Integration of the results from the various beamlines revealed the minerals potential applications for high-performance concretes, including the encapsulation of hazardous wastes.

Lessons for the future

Environmentally friendly modern concretes already include volcanic ash or fly ash from coal-burning power plants as partial substitutes for Portland cement, with good results. These blended cements also produce C-A-S-H, but their long-term performance could not be determined until the Monteiro team analyzed Roman concrete.

Their analyses showed that the Roman recipe needed less than 10 percent lime by weight, made at two-thirds or less the temperature required by Portland cement. Lime reacting with aluminum-rich pozzolan ash and seawater formed highly stable C-A-S-H and Al-tobermorite, insuring strength and longevity. Both the materials and the way the Romans used them hold lessons for the future.

For us, pozzolan is important for its practical applications, says Monteiro. It could replace 40 percent of the worlds demand for Portland cement. And there are sources of pozzolan all over the world. Saudi Arabia doesnt have any fly ash, but it has mountains of pozzolan.

By Kathy Finn and Timothy Gardner

NEW ORLEANS/WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Barry, which is expected to flood New Orleans and threaten lives along the Mississippi River, is being fueled by warmth in the Gulf of Mexico that was likely exacerbated by climate change, scientists said on Friday.

While no single storm can be linked directly to climate change, the trend of warming air and seas around the globe has caused conditions that scientists say will, on average, make storms stronger and rainier.

""The real increased threat from a warming climate is an atmosphere that's capable of producing higher intensity precipitation events,"" said Jill Trepanier, an expert in extreme climatic and weather events at Louisiana State University.

She said warmer air in the Gulf of Mexico will likely add fuel to the storm, while warmer ocean temperatures there will fill it with vast amounts of evaporated water that can lead to dangerous flooding.

Louisiana officials have warned residents that Barry, expected to make landfall on Saturday, could inundate areas along the lower Mississippi with up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain.

The lower Mississippi has already been running at flood stage for months after the so-called ""bomb cyclone"" and other storms starting in March that dumped huge volumes of rain on Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri - which flowed down the Mississippi and could further feed moisture to Barry, scientists said. .

""The water over land actually helps the storm,"" Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded office, said about the double-whammy.

Residents were ordered to evacuate some nearby areas, but New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said no evacuations were ordered from the city. Cantrell, a Democrat, said at a news conference she believes climate change is making storms worse. ""It's real. We're seeing it through the country and the world.""

The city is particularly vulnerable to storms because it is ""below sea level, protected by levees and pumping systems that remove rainwater, which cannot drain naturally,"" the Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 on its website, an entry moved to a web archive by the Trump administration.

Not all storms will be wetter as a result of climate change, but on average more of them will https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0673-2, scientists said.

In a recent record wet storm, Hurricane Harvey flooded the Houston area in 2017, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed the New Orleans region and killed 1,500 people with high winds and levee-bursting floods.

""We might have four or five times as much warming over the coming century as the last, so these kinds of weather events are likely to get much, much worse,"" said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.

Development in the New Orleans region, a major oil hub, has made the area more vulnerable to storms, with the removal of wetlands which help protect coasts. Trepanier said the city has made some advances to protect against storm surge, but when storms meet river flooding it makes for a ""more combined and complicated risk.""





TOXIC SITES AT RISK

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has cast doubt on mainstream climate change science and announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement, an international accord to fight climate change, saying it burdens the country with costs.

He boasted about his administration's environmental record at a speech at the White House this week, but did not mention climate change, and he has rolled back Obama-era regulations targeting carbon emissions.

The EPA, which is in change of toxic waste sites and was forced to address flooded sites that released dangerous chemicals into waters during Hurricane Harvey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Barry.

Green group Environment America said there were more than 100 Superfund environmental cleanup sites and 17 oil refineries in the path of the storm.

Cantrell, a Democrat, said at a news conference she believes climate change is making storms worse. ""It's real. We're seeing it through the country and the world.""<br><br>The city is particularly vulnerable to storms because it is ""below sea level, protected by levees and pumping systems that remove rainwater, which cannot drain naturally,"" the Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 on its website, an entry moved to a web archive by the Trump administration.<br><br>Not all storms will be wetter as a result of climate change, but on average more of them will https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0673-2, scientists said.<br><br>In a recent record wet storm, Hurricane Harvey flooded the Houston area in 2017, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed the New Orleans region and killed 1,500 people with high winds and levee-bursting floods.<br><br>""We might have four or five times as much warming over the coming century as the last, so these kinds of weather events are likely to get much, much worse,"" said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.<br><br>Development in the New Orleans region, a major oil hub, has made the area more vulnerable to storms, with the removal of wetlands which help protect coasts. Trepanier said the city has made some advances to protect against storm surge, but when storms meet river flooding it makes for a ""more combined and complicated risk.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>TOXIC SITES AT RISK<br><br>President Donald Trump, a Republican, has cast doubt on mainstream climate change science and announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement, an international accord to fight climate change, saying it burdens the country with costs.<br><br>He boasted about his administration's environmental record at a speech at the White House this week, but did not mention climate change, and he has rolled back Obama-era regulations targeting carbon emissions.<br><br>The EPA, which is in change of toxic waste sites and was forced to address flooded sites that released dangerous chemicals into waters during Hurricane Harvey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Barry.<br><br>Green group Environment America said there were more than 100 Superfund environmental cleanup sites and 17 oil refineries in the path of the storm.

Tokyo, Nov 14 (AFP) Nov 14, 2018



Climate change is increasing the amount of rain that hurricanes produce, and as warming picks up storms will become increasingly wetter and windier, according to new research.

The findings are based on extensive modelling that involved millions of computing hours on a supercomputer, and they show that climate change is already affecting the intensity of storms.

""Climate change so far -- from preindustrial to present -- has contributed to increases in total storm rainfall from Hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria of about 5-10 percent,"" said the study's lead author Christina Patricola.

""Our simulations also strongly indicate that we can expect to see even greater increases in rainfall and stronger winds by the end of the century,"" she told AFP.

Patricola and co-author Michael Wehner, both researchers at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, started by analysing three major hurricanes: Katrina, Irma and Maria.

They used what Wehner refers to as a ""hindcast attribution method"" simulating first the scenario in which the storm occurred, and then a ""counterfactual"" storm in a world where climate change did not occur.

By comparing the difference between the two models, the researchers were able to determine which elements resulted from climate change.

They found climate change at the time of Katrina, which devastated parts of the United States in 2005, had increased the storm's rainfall by 4-9 percent.

It increased the rain from Irma, an immensely costly storm that hit in 2017, by six percent, and upped the rainfall from Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico the same year, by nine percent.

The models suggested climate had not so far affected wind speed, but rainfall can be more devastating than high winds, causing deadly flooding and enormous damage.



- Wetter, windier storms -



""We think that climate change has increased rainfall because the ocean and atmosphere have already started warming, which means the atmosphere can hold more moisture,"" said Patricola, while cautioning that other factors including changing storm dynamics could be at play.

The researchers then expanded their study and analysed a total of 15 tropical cyclones -- storms that include Atlantic hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and cyclones around Australia.

In addition to comparing the actual storms to pre-industrial conditions, they looked at how the storms would unfold under various theoretical climate change scenarios involving different temperature rises.

They found rainfall could increase between 15 and 35 percent in the future, with wind speeds increasing by as much as 25 knots.

The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, comes after an active storm season that saw powerful hurricanes and devastating typhoons.

And it was published at the same time as another study in Nature that found urbanisation in the US city of Houston directly contributed to the rainfall and flooding in 2017's Hurricane Harvey.

The research found urban growth ate up land that could have absorbed rainfall, but also led to Harvey producing more rain for reasons including the way buildings affect air flow.

Patricola and Wehner cautioned that their work uses one climate model, and further study will be needed to see if their results can be replicated.

Tokyo, Nov 14 (AFP) Nov 14, 2018



Climate change is increasing the amount of rain that hurricanes produce, and as warming picks up storms will become increasingly wetter and windier, according to new research.

The findings are based on extensive modelling that involved millions of computing hours on a supercomputer, and they show that climate change is already affecting the intensity of storms.

""Climate change so far -- from preindustrial to present -- has contributed to increases in total storm rainfall from Hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria of about 5-10 percent,"" said the study's lead author Christina Patricola.

""Our simulations also strongly indicate that we can expect to see even greater increases in rainfall and stronger winds by the end of the century,"" she told AFP.

Patricola and co-author Michael Wehner, both researchers at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, started by analysing three major hurricanes: Katrina, Irma and Maria.

They used what Wehner refers to as a ""hindcast attribution method"" simulating first the scenario in which the storm occurred, and then a ""counterfactual"" storm in a world where climate change did not occur.

By comparing the difference between the two models, the researchers were able to determine which elements resulted from climate change.

They found climate change at the time of Katrina, which devastated parts of the United States in 2005, had increased the storm's rainfall by 4-9 percent.

It increased the rain from Irma, an immensely costly storm that hit in 2017, by six percent, and upped the rainfall from Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico the same year, by nine percent.

The models suggested climate had not so far affected wind speed, but rainfall can be more devastating than high winds, causing deadly flooding and enormous damage.

""We think that climate change has increased rainfall because the ocean and atmosphere have already started warming, which means the atmosphere can hold more moisture,"" said Patricola, while cautioning that other factors including changing storm dynamics could be at play.

The researchers then expanded their study and analysed a total of 15 tropical cyclones -- storms that include Atlantic hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and cyclones around Australia.

In addition to comparing the actual storms to pre-industrial conditions, they looked at how the storms would unfold under various theoretical climate change scenarios involving different temperature rises.

They found rainfall could increase between 15 and 35 percent in the future, with wind speeds increasing by as much as 25 knots.

The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, comes after an active storm season that saw powerful hurricanes and devastating typhoons.

And it was published at the same time as another study in Nature that found urbanisation in the US city of Houston directly contributed to the rainfall and flooding in 2017's Hurricane Harvey.

The research found urban growth ate up land that could have absorbed rainfall, but also led to Harvey producing more rain for reasons including the way buildings affect air flow.

Patricola and Wehner cautioned that their work uses one climate model, and further study will be needed to see if their results can be replicated.

They also plan to study further the way climate change affects wind intensity and what other factors play a role in the impact of major storms.

At least among Americans, there's this idea that your soul mate, your dream job, and a shoe that fits you perfectly is out there. You just have to find it.

The assumption is that unless you discover that perfect match, you won't be satisfied.

But new research casts some doubt on that assumption, at least when it comes to work. Some people inherently believe that they can grow to love their job over time -- and they generally end up just as happy as those who seek out the ideal fit from the start.

The study, led by Patricia Chen, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, divides people into two camps: ""fit theorists"" and ""develop theorists.""

Fit theorists believe in the fairy tale: Passion is something that's found. According to a series of experiments that the researchers conducted, the majority of people are fit theorists. Fewer are develop theorists, who think you can cultivate passion, even if you don't necessarily feel it at the outset.

In the study, fit theorists were more likely to say they would take a (hypothetical) low-paying job that offers enjoyable work; develop theorists tended to say they would take a high-paying job that doesn't involve very enjoyable work.

It might seem as though fit theorists would end up happier in the long run, but that wasn't what the evidence suggested.

The researchers asked participants questions about their actual jobs, including, ""How good a fit do you think there is between you and your current line of work now?"" They asked similar questions about how well-matched participants felt when they first started their current job.

Participants also reported how passionate they felt towards their work; how satisfied their were with their work; and how successful they thought they were in their work.

Results showed that fit theorists were more likely to say they felt well-suited to their job initially. But when it came to their current feelings about their work, fit and develop theorists were similarly passionate and satisfied. They felt equally successful and made comparable incomes.

In other words, your implicit beliefs about achieving passion at work can shape your expectations and your decisions -- but probably not your levels of happiness and success.

Steve Jobs famously said, ""The only way to do great work is to love what you do."" Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Chen says these findings are revelatory in light of popular messages about achieving passion for work. (The study authors quote Steve Jobs, who famously said, ""The only way to do great work is to love what you do."") Her research suggests that you can still be happy and successful even if you don't love what you do at first -- as long as you believe that love will come eventually.

Chen thinks that the notion of knowing what you love and finding work that allows you to do that is probably unique to Western cultures, which generally place a high value on independence. In the future, she hopes to conduct similar research in East Asian countries.

She may also study whether develop theory is overall a healthier approach to achieving passion at work than fit theory. Right now, she sees advantages and disadvantages to both mindsets.

As for develop theorists, ""they will probably be more tolerant of difficulties integrating into new vocations (and perhaps even new work environments) because starting fit isn't as big a priority for them,"" Chen said. On the other hand, the downside is that develop theorists ""may even persist longer than psychologically healthy for them in a vocation that is really unsuitable.""

Fit theorists are very efficient about searching for their job match and determine pretty quickly whether they'd be suited to a particular line of work. ""However, the reality is that you've got to be in a practical position to be picky if you want to adopt this approach,"" Chen said. Not everyone has the means to turn down every job that comes their way because it doesn't seem enjoyable.

Obviously, you can switch gigs -- which isn't always easy to do, especially in a tight job market. Or you can try changing your beliefs about how to achieve passion at work.

Chen said that research hasn't yet established whether psychologists can help people change this way. She pointed to another study, which found that 20-minute interventions can change people's beliefs about whether intelligence is fixed or malleable. A similar approach might work with fit theorists.

Contrary to popular wisdom, you don't have to fall in love at first sight with a potential job. There's more than one way to get a passion for your work.

""The good news is that we can choose to change our beliefs or strategies to cultivate passion gradually or seek compatibility from the outset, and be just as effective in the long run at achieving this coveted experience,"" says Patricia Chen, a doctoral psychology student at the University of Michigan, and lead author of a new study.

The dominant mentality in America is the belief that passion comes from finding a fit with the right line of work, or ""following one's passion."" An alternative mindset is that passion can be cultivated over time as one gains competence in a line of work.

Researchers examined people's expectations, choices, and outcomes associated with each of these two mindsets--termed as the ""fit theory"" and ""develop theory.""

They found that both mentalities are similarly effective at achieving vocational well-being. What differs is how they motivate people to get to this outcome, Chen says.

People with the fit theory tend to select vocations that they enjoy from the outset - an indication of compatibility that is important to them.

In contrast, people with the develop theory prioritize an immediate vocational fit less, but focus on cultivating passion and fit over time.

""Thus, they are more likely to prioritize vocational characteristics other than immediate enjoyment, such as pay,"" Chen says.

The findings appear in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

James S. Ware, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., from Imperial College London, and colleagues examined the role of variation in cardiomyopathy-associated genes in the pathophysiology of ACM. A total of 141 ACM cases, 716 DCM cases, and 445 healthy volunteers were characterized. The prevalence of rare, protein-altering variants in nine genes associated with inherited DCM was assessed.

The researchers found that patients with ACM had a higher prevalence of variants in well-characterized DCM-causing genes than controls (13.5 versus 2.9 percent); the prevalence was similar for patients with ACM and DCM (19.4 percent). Patients with ACM also had a predominant burden of titin truncating variants (TTNtv) (9.9 percent). In a cohort of DCM patients not meeting ACM criteria, there was an interaction between TTN genotype and excess alcohol consumption. On multivariate analysis, an 8.7 percent absolute reduction in ejection fraction was seen in DCM patients with TTNtv who consumed excess alcohol versus those without TTNtv and excess alcohol consumption.

""Familial evaluation and genetic testing should be considered in patients presenting with ACM,"" the authors write.

Scientists have revealed a new link between alcohol, heart health and our genes.

Scientists have revealed a new link between alcohol, heart health and our genes.

The researchers investigated faulty versions of a gene called titin which are carried by one in 100 people or 600,000 people in the UK.

Titin is crucial for maintaining the elasticity of the heart muscle, and faulty versions are linked to a type of heart failure called dilated cardiomyopathy.

Now new research suggests the faulty gene may interact with alcohol to accelerate heart failure in some patients with the gene, even if they only drink moderate amounts of alcohol.

The research was carried out by scientists from Imperial College London, Royal Brompton Hospital, and MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, and published this week in the latest edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

The study was supported by the Department of Health and Social Care and the Wellcome Trust through the Health Innovation Challenge Fund.





In the first part of the study, the team analysed 141 patients with a type of heart failure called alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM). This condition is triggered by drinking more than 70 units a week (roughly seven bottles of wine) for five years or more. In severe cases the condition can be fatal, or leave patients requiring a heart transplant.

The team found that the faulty titin gene may also play a role in the condition. In the study 13.5 per cent of patients were found to carry the mutation - much higher than the proportion of people who carry them in the general population.

These results suggest this condition is not simply the result of alcohol poisoning, but arises from a genetic predisposition - and that other family members may be at risk too, explained Dr James Ware, study author from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial.

""Our research strongly suggests alcohol and genetics are interacting - and genetic predisposition and alcohol consumption can act together to lead to heart failure. At the moment this condition is assumed to be simply due to too much alcohol. But this research suggests these patients should also be checked for a genetic cause - by asking about a family history and considering testing for a faulty titin gene, as well as other genes linked to heart failure,"" he said.

He added that relatives of patients with ACM should receive assessment and heart scans - and in some cases have genetic tests - to see if they unknowingly carry the faulty gene.





In a second part of the study, the researchers investigated whether alcohol may play a role in another type of heart failure called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This condition causes the heart muscle to become stretched and thin, and has a number of causes including viral infections and certain medications. The condition can also be genetic, and around 12 per cent of cases of DCM are thought to be linked to a faulty titin gene.





In the study the team asked 716 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy how much alcohol they consumed.





None of the patients consumed the high-levels of alcohol needed to cause ACM. But the team found that in patients whose DCM was caused by the faulty titin gene, even moderately increased alcohol intake (defined as drinking above the weekly recommended limit of 14 units), affected the heart's pumping power.

Compared to DCM patients who didn't consume excess alcohol (and whose condition wasn't caused by the faulty titin gene), excess alcohol was linked to reduction in heart output of 30 per cent.

More research is now needed to investigate how alcohol may affect people who carry the faulty titin gene, but do not have heart problems, added Dr Paul Barton, study co-author from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial:

""Alcohol and the heart have a complicated relationship. While moderate levels may have benefits for heart health, too much can cause serious cardiac problems. This research suggests that in people with titin-related heart failure, alcohol may worsen the condition.

""An important wider question is also raised by the study: do mutations in titin predispose people to heart failure when exposed to other things that stress the heart, such as cancer drugs or certain viral infections? This is something we are actively seeking to address.""

The research was supported by the Department of Health and Social Care and Wellcome Trust through the Health Innovation Challenge Fund, the Medical Research Council, the NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and the British Heart Foundation.

The recent measles outbreak in Minnesota -- by June, new cases of the disease in that state surpassed nationwide totals for all of 2016 -- has been a sobering reminder of how highly concentrated populations of vaccination skeptics can elevate an entire community's risk of infection.

Around the edges of every headline-grabbing outbreak, there's a vast range of opinions being circulated about the risks and benefits of early childhood immunization. The vaccination debate maintains a constant presence on social media platforms like Twitter, where people on both sides frequently share articles and blog posts to support their stance on the issue.

These varied viewpoints caught the attention of scientists at the Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech who are conducting a three-year study on the ways online interactions influence our beliefs.

Their latest research, published in the journal Vaccine, attempts to break down the ideas that are most closely associated with a pro- or anti-immunization stance. The group's findings suggest that the debate around vaccination may hinge more on different understandings of risk, responsibility, and credibility than any particular set of scientific data.

""When we mapped out how these arguments are structured, we found that anti-vaccination content tended to focus on children and their need to be protected,"" said Gloria Kang, a Ph.D. candidate at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. ""Pro-vaccination content, on the other hand, centered on parents and their obligation to keep kids' immunizations up-to-date--so the basic notion of whose interests are at stake in this debate are completely flipped.""

Researchers developed their rankings of vaccination-related concepts shared on social media using ""semantic networks."" This is a framework frequently used by psychologists to explain how information gets stored in our long-term memory by plugging it into an existing network of related concepts.

Psychological research suggests that those related concepts will function like a pathway our brain will follow when attempting to recall thoughts and opinions on that topic in the future. This ""spreading activation theory"" says our memories are never accessed directly. Instead, our brains are constantly employing conceptual landmarks to find their way back.

""A single phrase can conjure up completely different images in our minds, depending on how that concept is organized in our mental models,"" said Samarth Swarup, a research assistant professor in the Biocomplexity Institute's Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory. ""For example, we found that pro-vaccination posts tend to closely associate governmental organizations like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with specific research they've performed on vaccine safety, whereas anti-vaccination content aligns the CDC with private business interests, such as 'Big Pharma.'""

Looking forward, information from this study could be a valuable tool for scientists and policymakers trying to address the public's mounting concerns about vaccination safety. Interactive maps charting out core concepts on both sides of the debate are currently available online along with the research team's full dataset.

""The longer it takes for us to reach a common understanding on vaccination, the more opportunities there will be for diseases like measles to regain their foothold in the U.S.,"" said Kang. ""Understanding which concepts truly speak to the other side could help us waste less time talking past one another.""

Escherichia coli K1 (E. coli K1) continues to be a major threat to the health of young infants. Affecti",0.125,1,"Study shows why glucose levels are reduced in the brains of children with E. coli K1 meningitis

Escherichia coli K1 (E. coli K1) continues to be a major threat to the health of young infants. Affecting the central nervous system, it causes neonatal meningitis by multiplying in immune cells, such as macrophages, and then disseminating into the bloodstream to subsequently invade the blood-brain barrier. Neonatal and childhood meningitis in particular results in long-term neurological problems such as seizures or ADHD in up to half of the survivors.

Meningitis can be caused by bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. One hallmark of bacterial meningitis is reduced glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients, which allows a physician to quickly begin appropriate antibiotic treatment.

The reason for the reduced glucose levels associated with bacterial meningitis was believed to be the need for glucose as fuel by infiltrating immune cells in response to infection. However, the possibility that the bacteria itself could manipulate glucose concentrations in the brain had not been explored before now.

Scientists at The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) report that glucose transporters, which transfer glucose from the blood to the brain, are inhibited byE. coli K1 during meningitis.

""We found that expression of glucose transporters is completely shut down by bacteria, leaving insufficient fuel for the immune cells to fight off the infection,"" said the study's first author, Subramanian Krishnan, PhD, of the Division of Infectious Diseases at CHLA.

Specifically, the study -- reported online in The Journal of Infectious Diseases -- shows that E. coliK1 modulates the protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) levels at the blood-brain barrier in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. This causes inhibition of glucose uptake and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity.

The suppression of PPAR-g and GLUT-1 levels in mouse models of bacterial meningitis caused extensive neurological effects. The researchers showed that a two-day treatment regimen with partial or selective PPAR-g agonists (Telmisartan and Rosiglitazone -- both FDA-approved drugs) ameliorated the pathological outcomes of infection in mice by inducing expression of glucose transporters.

""Modulation of PPAR-g and GLUT-1 levels may boost the immune system to fight infection,"" said principal investigator Prasadarao V.

Escherichia coli K1 (E. coli K1) continues to be a major threat to the health of young infants. Affecting the central nervous system, it causes neonatal meningitis by multiplying in immune cells, such as macrophages, and then disseminating into the bloodstream to subsequently invade the blood-brain barrier. Neonatal and childhood meningitis in particular results in long-term neurological problems such as seizures or ADHD in up to half of the survivors.

Meningitis can be caused by bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. One hallmark of bacterial meningitis is reduced glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients, which allows a physician to quickly begin appropriate antibiotic treatment.

The reason for the reduced glucose levels associated with bacterial meningitis was believed to be the need for glucose as fuel by infiltrating immune cells in response to infection. However, the possibility that the bacteria itself could manipulate glucose concentrations in the brain had not been explored before now.

Scientists at The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) report that glucose transporters, which transfer glucose from the blood to the brain, are inhibited byE. coli K1 during meningitis.

""We found that expression of glucose transporters is completely shut down by bacteria, leaving insufficient fuel for the immune cells to fight off the infection,"" said the study's first author, Subramanian Krishnan, PhD, of the Division of Infectious Diseases at CHLA.

Specifically, the study -- reported online in The Journal of Infectious Diseases -- shows that E. coliK1 modulates the protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) levels at the blood-brain barrier in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. This causes inhibition of glucose uptake and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity.

The suppression of PPAR-g and GLUT-1 levels in mouse models of bacterial meningitis caused extensive neurological effects. The researchers showed that a two-day treatment regimen with partial or selective PPAR-g agonists (Telmisartan and Rosiglitazone -- both FDA-approved drugs) ameliorated the pathological outcomes of infection in mice by inducing expression of glucose transporters.

""Modulation of PPAR-g and GLUT-1 levels may boost the immune system to fight infection,"" said principal investigator Prasadarao V. Nemani, PhD of CHLA and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.

(Nanowerk News) Even a perfect vacuum is not truly empty. If you could observe that vacuum on the quantum, atomic or subatomic scale, you would see a bubbling soup of ""ghost"" particles. Known as virtual particles, they randomly pop in and out of existence in the empty space; and they cause a phenomenon known as vacuum fluctuation. So, in a space that is completely devoid of any detectable radiation  that is, a vacuum existing at the temperature of absolute- zero  fluctuations in electromagnetic fields will still be taking place on a microscopic, quantum scale.

Though they are called virtual, these particles create real forces between atoms. If you place two atoms close together, they will change the local vacuum between them, creating fluctuations through virtual photons  light particles. The attraction between these close-together atoms is called the van der Waals force. Place the atoms farther apart, and you will still observe a slight pull between them. This is the Casimir force. Both of these forces are weak and often hard to measure.

Prof. Gershon Kurizki and research student Ephraim Shahmoon, of the Weizmann Institutes Chemical Physics Department, together with Dr. Igor Mazets of the Vienna University of Technology recently suggested a way of enormously enhancing these forces  until they become a sort of quantum glue holding atoms together.

In their paper, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (""Giant vacuum forces via transmission lines""), the researchers considered atoms placed near a line of conducting material, similar to an ordinary coaxial cable used to hook a TV to a satellite dish. In the setup they envision, a virtual photon that is emitted from one atom would be confined so that it propagates in one dimension to the nearest atom down the line, where it would be absorbed, then reemitted back to the first atom and so on.

Possible ""quantum glue"" setup: Coaxial line: two concentric metallic cylinders, the inner one with radius a and the outer (hollow) one with radius b. Two dipoles represented by black circles are placed in between the cylinders, along the wave propagation direction z. They interact via modes of the coaxial line that are in the vacuum state, giving rise to a vdW-like interaction energy.

Having this exchange of virtual photons occur under one-dimensional confinement, rather than in everyday three-dimensional space, greatly increases the odds that the process will take place. The researchers calculations suggest that the attraction between atoms via virtual photons in the electric coaxial cable could be millions of times greater than that in three-dimensional space, transforming a normally weak force into potent "" glue.""

(Nanowerk News) A new fuel-cell concept, developed by an Michigan State University researcher, will allow biodiesel plants to eliminate the creation of hazardous wastes while removing their dependence on fossil fuel from their production process.

The platform, which uses microbes to glean ethanol from glycerol and has the added benefit of cleaning up the wastewater, will allow producers to reincorporate the ethanol and the water into the fuel-making process, said Gemma Reguera, MSU microbiologist and one of the co-authors.

With a saturated glycerol market, traditional approaches see producers pay hefty fees to have toxic wastewater hauled off to treatment plants, she said. By cleaning the water with microbes on-site, weve come up with a way to allow producers to generate bioethanol, which replaces petrochemical methanol. At the same time, they are taking care of their hazardous waste problem.

The results, which appear in the journal Environmental Science and Technology (""Fermentation of Glycerol into Ethanol in a Microbial Electrolysis Cell Driven by a Customized Consortium""), show that the key to Regueras platform is her patented adaptive-engineered bacteria  Geobacter sulfurreducens.

Geobacter are naturally occurring microbes that have proved promising in cleaning up nuclear waste as well in improving other biofuel processes. Much of Regueras research with these bacteria focuses on engineering their conductive pili or nanowires. These hair-like appendages are the managers of electrical activity during a cleanup and biofuel production.

First, Reguera, along with lead authors and MSU graduate students Allison Speers and Jenna Young, evolved Geobacter to withstand increasing amounts of toxic glycerol. The next step, the team searched for partner bacteria that could ferment it into ethanol while generating byproducts that fed the Geobacter.

It took some tweaking, but we eventually developed a robust bacterium to pair with Geobacter, Reguera said. We matched them up like dance partners, modifying each of them to work seamlessly together and eliminate all of the waste.

Together, the bacterias appetite for the toxic byproducts is inexhaustible.

They feast like theyre at a Las Vegas buffet, she added. One bacterium ferments the glycerol waste to produce bioethanol, which can be reused to make biodiesel from oil feedstocks. Geobacter removes any waste produced during glycerol fermentation to generate electricity. It is a win-win situation.

The hungry microbes are the featured component of Regueras microbial electrolysis cells, or MECs. These fuel cells do not harvest electricity as an output. Rather, they use a small electrical input platform to generate hydrogen and increase the MECs efficiency even more.

The promising process already has caught the eye of economic developers, who are helping scale up the effort.

Biodiesel plants, while ""green,"" are not entirely environmentally sustainable. Now a pair of genetically engineered microbes may be the perfect solution, cleaning up biodiesel plant wastewater while producing ethanol and electricity to help fuel the fuel-making process.

According to Michigan State University (MSU) researcher Gemma Reguera, current bio-diesel plants ""pay hefty fees to have toxic wastewater hauled off to treatment plants"" - a problem which makes the ""green"" fuel costly and not entirely sustainable, according to a university press release.

To solve this problem, Reuguera and a team of graduate students genetically tweaked a microbe called Geobacter so that it could thrive in heavy amounts of toxic glycerol - a toxin that is the byproduct of traditional biofuel production. Geobacter, which have shown promise in cleaning up nuclear waste in past studies, have also been known to manage electrical activity during biofuel production, increasing the efficiency of the process.

Another bacteria was then incorporated that could ferment toxic glycerol into ethanol while simultaneously producing byproducts that the Gerobacter could survive off.

""We matched them up like dance partners, modifying each of them to work seamlessly together and eliminate all of the waste,"" Reugera said. ""One bacterium ferments the glycerol waste to produce bioethanol, which can be reused to make biodiesel from oil feedstocks. Geobacter removes any waste produced during glycerol fermentation to generate electricity. It is a win-win situation.""

In-fact, it's such a 'win-win,' that the patented process, which was presented in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, has already garnered attention of economic developers.

""Through a Michigan Translational Research and Commercialization grant, Reguera and her team are developing prototypes that can handle larger volumes of waste,"" according to an MSU press release.

Still, it will likely be a long time before any industrial sized microbe-assisted bio-fuel plants begin popping up across the country. As of now, it has only been successfully achieved on a small scale in a lab-controlled environment.

High blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin to turn blood glucose into energy. Although high blood sugar usually only affects diabetics, hyperglycemia has been associated with poorer outcomes for patients undergoing surgical procedures. A recent study by University of Missouri School of Medicine researchers found that following surgery for artery disease of the legs, hyperglycemia can cause complications, increased hospitalizations and mortality for all patients - even those who are not diabetic.

""Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is a common circulatory problem caused by plaque build-up inside the arteries of the legs,"" said Todd Vogel, M.D., associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. ""This build-up blocks blood flow to the lower extremities, and usually requires surgical intervention. Patients with PAD often have additional health concerns such as diabetes. Our study looked at how common hyperglycemia is following surgery for PAD and how it affects post-surgical outcomes.""

For the observational study, Vogel's team used the Cerner Health Facts database to review 3,586 patient cases. Sixty-seven hospitals were represented in the study - all located in urban areas.

Results of the study indicated that one in five patients undergoing vascular procedures had postoperative hyperglycemia. High blood sugar following PAD surgery was associated with poorer outcomes in patients with and without diabetes, including increased infection rates, hospital stays and mortality. No difference was found with respect to hospital readmissions.

""Our study demonstrated that postoperative hyperglycemia is common after lower extremity procedures,"" Vogel said. ""Patients with postoperative high blood sugar without a diagnosis of diabetes were just as likely to experience complications as those with diabetes. They were about twice as likely to have an infection and a hospital stay longer than 10 days. They also had higher odds of in-hospital mortality.""

Although the patient population covered by the Cerner Health Facts database was comparable to the general U.S. population, Vogel said there was a limitation to the study. Coding used to identify procedures and diagnoses can vary between health systems. However, data undergo rigorous evaluation before being added to Cerner Health Facts.

""I think of most interest was that diabetes alone was not associated with an increase in infection rates, length of stay or mortality,"" Vogel said. ""Although more research is needed, this suggests that post-procedure hyperglycemia is a significant risk factor for outcomes following lower extremity vascular procedures. Glucose management may represent an important method for improving outcomes following surgical interventions.""

The study, ""The Association of Postoperative Glycemic Control and Lower Extremity Procedure Outcomes,"" recently was published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery.

The key ingredient for the ink is microparticles oriented in a certain configuration by a magnetic field. Because of the way they're oriented, particles on both sides of a tear are magnetically attracted to one another, causing a device printed with the ink to heal itself. The devices repair tears as wide as 3 millimeters--a record in the field of self-healing systems.

Researchers detailed their findings in Science Advances.

""Our work holds considerable promise for widespread practical applications for long-lasting printed electronic devices,"" said Joseph Wang, director of the Center for Wearable Sensors and chair of the nanoengineering department at UC San Diego.

Existing self-healing materials require an external trigger to kick start the healing process. They also take anywhere between a few minutes to several days to work. By contrast, the system developed by Wang and colleagues doesn't require any outside catalyst to work. Damage is repaired within about 50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds).

Engineers used the ink to print batteries, electrochemical sensors and wearable, textile-based electrical circuits (see video). They then set about damaging these devices by cutting them and pulling them apart to create increasingly wide gaps. Researchers repeatedly damaged the devices nine times at the same location. They also inflicted damage in four different places on the same device. The devices still healed themselves and recovered their function while losing a minimum amount of conductivity.

For example, nanoengineers printed a self-healing circuit on the sleeve of a T-shirt and connected it with an LED light and a coin battery. The researchers then cut the circuit and the fabric it was printed on. At that point, the LED turned off. But then within a few seconds it started turning back on as the two sides of the circuit came together again and healed themselves, restoring conductivity.

""We wanted to develop a smart system with impressive self-healing abilities with easy-to-find, inexpensive materials,"" said Amay Bandodkar, one of the papers' first authors, who earned his Ph.D. in Wang's lab and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University.

Fabrication

Wang's research group is a leader in the field of printed wearable sensors, so his team of nanoengineers naturally turned to ink as a starting point for their self-healing system.

Engineers loaded the ink with microparticles made of a type of magnet commonly used in research and made of neodymium, a soft, silvery metal. The particles' magnetic field is much larger than their individual size. This is the key to the ink's self-healing properties because the attraction between the particles leads to closing tears that are millimeters wide.

The particles also conduct electricity and are inexpensive. But they have poor electrochemical properties, making them difficult to use in the electrochemical devices, such as sensors, on their own. To remedy this problem, researchers added carbon black to the ink, a material commonly used to make batteries and sensors.

But researchers realized that the microparticles' magnetic fields, when in their natural configuration, canceled each other out, which robbed them of their healing properties. Engineers solved this by printing the ink in the presence of an external magnetic field, which ensured that the particles oriented themselves to behave as a permanent magnet with two opposite poles at the end of each printed device. When the device is cut in two, the two damaged pieces act as different magnets that attract each other and self-heal.

In the future, engineers envision making different inks with different ingredients for a wide range of applications. In addition, they plan to develop computer simulations to test different self-healing ink recipes in silico before trying them out in the lab.

For decades, researchers believed that the fir",0.4285714285714285,1,"An astounding discovery made at an archaeological site in Texas is prompting scientists to question what we know about the colonization of the Americas.

For decades, researchers believed that the first to set foot on the continent were the Clovis people -- a Paleoamerican tribe that settled in North America some 13,000 years ago.

This ancient community invented what is now known as the ""Clovis point"" -- a leaf-shaped, or lanceolate, spear point (imaged above) which was made out of stone and was used to hunt mammoths, mastodons, and other extinct beasts of the Late Pleistocene.

But a spectacular find announced yesterday by the Texas A&M University suggests that the Americas may have been already inhabited when the Clovis people first emerged on the territory. During a dig at the Debra L. Friedkin site located some 40 miles northwest of Austin, researchers unearthed spear points that predate the Clovis culture.

The ancient ""projectile points"" date back to 15,500 years ago and are believed to be the oldest weapons to ever be discovered in North America, reports Science Daily.

According to the Washington Post, the newfound weapons look nothing like the ones used by the Clovis people and come in two different shapes -- a triangular lanceolate point, which bears a close resemblance to a predator's sharp tooth, and a lanceolate stemmed point, shaped like a lobe with a tapered bottom.

This incredible discovery, detailed in the journal Science Advances, suggests that the famous Clovis points may have evolved from an earlier spearpoint technology. This, in turn, hints that the Clovis culture might actually have been created by the descendants of the earliest American settlers, notes Science News.

""We have discovered two previously unknown spearpoint styles that predate Clovis,"" said study lead author Michael Waters, who has been working at the site for more than a decade.

""The findings expand our understanding of the earliest people to explore and settle [in] North America.""

The pre-Clovis spear points are made of a type of quartz known as chert and were discovered alongside tools buried under several feet of sediment. All in all, the archaeologists dug up 12 never-before-seen spear points -- two perfectly preserved ones and 10 additional fragments.

""These points were found under a layer with Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Clovis is dated to 13,000 to 12,700 years ago and Folsom after that,"" explained Waters, who pointed out that the pre-Clovis weapons were undoubtedly ""used for hunting game in the area at that time.""

Scientists believe newly-discovered, 15,500-year-old spear points are the oldest weapons ever found in North America.

The findings raise new questions about the settlement of early peoples on the continent.

As reported in Science Advances, scientists found numerous weapons--about 3-4 inches long--while digging at the Debra L. Friedkin site, named for the family who owns the land about 40 miles northwest of Austin in central Texas. The site has undergone extensive archaeological work for the past 12 years.

Researchers found spear points made of chert and other tools red under several feet of sediment that dating revealed to be 15,500 years old, and pre-date Clovis, who for decades scientists believed to be the first people to enter the Americas.

Before Clovis

""There is no doubt these weapons were used for hunting game in the area at that time,"" says Michael Waters, a professor of anthropology and director of the Center for the Study of the First Americans at Texas A&M University.

""The discovery is significant because almost all pre-Clovis sites have stone tools, but spear points have yet to be found. These points were found under a layer with Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Clovis is dated to 13,000 to 12,700 years ago and Folsom after that,"" Waters says.

""The dream has always been to find diagnostic artifacts--such as projectile points--that can be recognized as older than Clovis and this is what we have at the Friedkin site.""

Mastodons and mammoths

Clovis is the name given to the distinctive tools people made starting around 13,000 years ago. The Clovis people invented the ""Clovis point,"" a spear-shaped weapon made of stone that researchers have found in Texas and parts of the United States and northern Mexico. Those weapons were made to hunt animals, including mammoths and mastodons, from 13,000 to 12,700 years ago.

""The findings expand our understanding of the earliest people to explore and settle North America,"" Waters says. ""The peopling of the Americas during the end of the last Ice Age was a complex process and this complexity is seen in their genetic record. Now we are starting to see this complexity mirrored in the archaeological record.""

Archaeologists have been scouring the Buttermilk Creek complex in central Texas since 2006, after an initial discovery there of scores of stone point fragments, which scientists suspected were the tips of pre-Clovis spearheads. Without any whole spearheads, however, it was difficult to determine whether these stone fragments were from tools, or if they were something else entirely.

Finally, though, eureka! Researchers have now confirmed that two perfectly preserved artifacts -- one triangular point, and one lobe-shaped projectile with a tapered, or ""stemmed"" bottom -- are, in fact, pre-Clovis in origin and human-crafted. They are different in design from Clovis points, and they significantly pre-date them. It's the clearcut evidence of pre-Clovis habitation of the Americas that researchers have been looking for.

Now, researchers have traced evidence of the bacteria's evolutionary history ",0.8,1,"Enterococci bacteria are the bane of hospitals, causing thousands of multidrug-resistant infections in patients each year. Now, researchers have traced evidence of the bacteria's evolutionary history back 425 million years and theorize that the same traits that allow the bacteria to thrive in hospitals likely emerged when they were carried onto land in the guts of the world's first terrestrial animals. The study was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Researchers at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard examined DNA from 24 species of enterococci, taken from the guts of a wide variety of animal and human hosts. The team calculated the average rate of genetic change within enterococcal species and compared genes of existing enterococci to those of related, non-enterococci bacteria. The analysis allowed the researchers to build an evolutionary timeline to estimate when key enterococci traits emerged. They then checked this timeline against the fossil record of terrestrial animal evolution.

All enterococci sampled were resistant to a common set of stresses-including antibiotics, disinfectants, drying and starvation-suggesting that the ancestors of all enterococci also shared these abilities. Enterococci appear to have developed these traits at around the same time that terrestrial animal life evolved. The researchers theorize that the ancestors of all enterococci lived in the guts of prehistoric aquatic animals, and as their hosts left the sea around 425 million years ago, the bacteria were carried along. Simultaneously, they evolved the traits needed to survive introduction into the harsher environment of dry land.

The researchers note that while their model is difficult to prove, it does partially explain the ability of enterococci to survive in hospital environments: they have long been equipped to thrive in a wide range of challenging environments. Having a better sense of what prompted the bacteria to evolve these abilities, the researchers say, could help control enterococci as the bacteria continue to circumvent hospital infection control methods.

Simultaneously, they evolved the traits needed to survive introduction into the harsher environment of dry land.

The researchers note that while their model is difficult to prove, it does partially explain the ability of enterococci to survive in hospital environments: they have long been equipped to thrive in a wide range of challenging environments. Having a better sense of what prompted the bacteria to evolve these abilities, the researchers say, could help control enterococci as the bacteria continue to circumvent hospital infection control methods.

The team calculated the average rate of genetic change within enterococcal species and compared genes of existing enterococci to those of related, non-enterococci bacteria. The analysis allowed the researchers to build an evolutionary timeline to estimate when key enterococci traits emerged. They then checked this timeline against the fossil record of terrestrial animal evolution.<br><br>All enterococci sampled were resistant to a common set of stresses-including antibiotics, disinfectants, drying and starvation-suggesting that the ancestors of all enterococci also shared these abilities.

""By analyzing the genomes and behaviors of today's enterococci, we were able to rewind the clock back to their earliest existence and piece together a picture of how these organisms were shaped into what they are today,"" said Dr. Ashlee Earl, group leader for the Bacterial Genomics Group at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and co-corresponding author of the study.

""Understanding how the environment in which microbes live leads to new properties could help us to predict how microbes will adapt to the use of antibiotics, antimicrobial hand soaps, disinfectants and other products intended to control their spread.""

The picture Dr. Earl and he colleagues from Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, pieced together begins with the dawn of life.

Bacteria arose nearly 4 billion years ago, and the Earth has teemed with them ever since, including the sea.

Animals first arose in the sea during the time known as the Cambrian Explosion, 542 million years ago.

As animals emerged in a sea of bacteria, bacteria learned to live in and on them. Some bacteria protect and serve the animals, as the healthy microorganisms in our intestines do today; others live in the environment, and still others cause disease.

As animals crawled onto land about 100 million years later, they took their bacteria with them.

Dr. Earl and co-authors found that all species of enterococci, including those that have never been found in hospitals, were naturally resistant to dryness, starvation, disinfectants and many antibiotics.

Because enterococci normally live in the intestines of most -- if not all -- land animals, it seemed likely that they were also in the intestines of land animals that are now extinct, including dinosaurs and the first millipede-like organisms to crawl onto land.

Comparison of the genomes of these bacteria provided evidence that this was indeed the case.

In fact, the authors found that new species of enterococci appeared whenever new types of animals appeared.

This includes when new types of animals arose right after they first crawled onto land, and when new types of animals arose right after mass extinctions, especially the greatest mass extinction, the end-Permian extinction (251 million years ago).

From sea animals, like fish, intestinal bacteria are excreted into the ocean, which usually contains about 5,000 mostly harmless bacteria per drop of water. They sink to the seafloor into microbe-rich sediments, and are consumed by worms, shellfish and other sea scavengers.

Those are then eaten by fish, and the bacteria continue to circulate throughout the food chain.

However, on land, intestinal bacteria are excreted as feces, where they often dry out and most die over time.

Not the enterococci, however. These bacteria are unusually hardy and can withstand drying out and starvation, which serves them well on land and in hospitals where disinfectants make it difficult for a microbe.

""We now know what genes were gained by enterococci hundreds of millions of years ago, when they became resistant to drying out, and to disinfectants and antibiotics that attack their cell walls,"" said lead author Dr. Michael S. Gilmore, Sir William Osler professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and senior scientist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. He also serves on the steering committees of the Harvard Microbial Sciences Initiative, and the Infectious Disease Initiative of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

""These are now targets for our research to design new types of antibiotics and disinfectants that specifically eliminate enterococci, to remove them as threats to hospitalized patients,"" said first author Dr. Francois Lebreton, from Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.

A new study details the only fossilized specimen of a species previously unknown to science--an ""obscure"" stalked filter feeder.

To the untrained eye, it looks like a flower crudely etched into rock--as if a child had scratched a picture of a bloom. But to the late fossil hunter Lloyd Gunther, the tulip shape he unearthed at Antimony Canyon in northern Utah looked like the remnant of an ancient marine animal.

Years ago, Gunther collected the rock and later gave it to researchers at the University of Kansas' Biodiversity Institute--just one among thousands of such fossils he donated to the institute over the years.

""...nearly every animal that we have around today has a relative that already lived during those times in the Cambrian.""

""This was the earliest specimen of a stalked filter feeder that has been found in North America,"" says Julien Kimmig, collections manager for Invertebrate Paleontology at the Biodiversity Institute and lead author of the paper in the Journal of Paleontology.

""This animal lived in soft sediment and anchored into the sediment. The upper part of the tulip was the organism itself. It had a stem attached to the ground and an upper part, called the calyx, that had everything from the digestive tract to the feeding mechanism. It was fairly primitive and weird.""

Kimmig researches the taxonomy, stratigraphy, and paleoecology of the Cambrian Spence Shale found in Utah and Idaho, where Gunther found the obscure filter feeder.

""The Spence Shale gives us soft-tissue preservation, so we get a much more complete biota in these environments,"" he says. ""This gives us a better idea of what the early world was like in the Cambrian. It's amazing to see what groups of animals had already appeared over 500 million years ago, like arthropods, worms, the first vertebrate animals--nearly every animal that we have around today has a relative that already lived during those times in the Cambrian.""

Second in its genus

In honor of fossil hunter Gunther, a preeminent collector who performed fieldwork from the 1930s to the 2000s, Kimmig and Biodiversity Institute colleagues Luke Strotz and Bruce Lieberman named the newly described species Siphusauctum lloydguntheri.

""It is enigmatic because we don't have anything living that is exactly like it.""

The stalked filter feeder is just the second animal placed within its genus, and the first Siphusauctum to be discovered outside the Burgess Shale, a fossil-rich deposit in the Canadian Rockies.

""What these animals were doing was filtering water to get food, like micro-plankton,"" Kimmig notes. ""The thing is, where this one was located we only found a single specimen over a period of 60 years of collecting in the area.""

Kimmig says it isn't yet known if the newly discovered stalked filter feeder lived a highly solitary life, or if it drifted off from a community of similar animals.

""It's hard to tell from a single specimen,"" he says. ""There were algae found right next to it, so it likely was transported there. The algae found with it were planktonic algae that were floating themselves. It could have fallen just next to it--but that would be a big coincidence--so that's why we're thinking it came loose from somewhere else and got mixed in with the algae.""

No living relatives

Kimmig and his colleagues say the newly described specimen varies in key areas from similar known species of stalked filter feeders from the Cambrian.

""There are several differences in how the animal looked,"" Kimmig says. ""If you look at the digestive tract preserved in this specimen, the lower digestive tract is closer to the base of the animal compared to other animals. The calyx is very slim--it looks like a white wine glass, whereas in other species it looks like a big goblet. What we don't have in this specimen that the others have are big branches for filter feeding. We don't know if those weren't preserved or if this one didn't have them.""

According to the researchers, there are no species alive today that claim lineage to Siphusauctum lloydguntheri. But Kimmig says there were a few contemporary examples that share similarities.

""The closest thing to the lifestyle--but not a relative--would be crinoids, commonly called sea lilies,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, there's likely not a relative of Siphusauctum in the world anymore. We have thousands of similar fossil specimens in the Burgess Shale, but it's hard to identify what these animals actually were. It might be possibly related to contemporary entoprocts, which are a lot smaller than this one--but it's hard to tell if they're related at all.""

Ultimately, the mysterious stalked filter feeder is a reminder of the strange and vast arc of evolution where species continuously come and go, according to Kimmig.

""It is enigmatic because we don't have anything living that is exactly like it,"" he says.

""What is fascinating about this animal is we can clearly relate it to animals existing in the Cambrian and then we just don't find it anymore. It's just fascinating to see how evolution works. Sometimes it creates something--and it just doesn't work out. We have some lineages like worms that lived long before the Cambrian and haven't changed in appearance or behavior, then we have things that were around for a couple of million years and just disappeared because they were chance victims of mass extinctions.""

But a group of University of Michigan researchers have developed a new way to design a ""metamaterial"" that allows the material to switch between being hard and soft without damaging or altering the material itself.

Metamaterials are man-made materials that get their properties--in this case, whether a material is hard or soft--from the way the material is constructed rather than the material that constructs it. This allows researchers to manipulate a metamaterial's structure in order to make the material exhibit a certain property.

In the group's study, published in the journal Nature Communications, the U-M researchers discovered a way to compose a metamaterial that can be easily manipulated to increase the stiffness of its surface by orders of magnitude--the difference between rubber and steel.

Since these properties are ""topologically protected,"" meaning that the material's properties come from its total structure, they're easily maintained even as the material shifts repeatedly between its hard and soft states.

""The novel aspect of this metamaterial is that its surface can change between hard and soft,"" said Xiaoming Mao, assistant professor of physics. ""Usually, it's hard to change the stiffness of a traditional material. It's either hard or soft after the material is made.""

For example, a dental filling cannot be changed after the dentist has set the filling without causing stress, either by drilling or grinding, to the original filling. A guitar string cannot be tightened without putting stress on the string itself, according to Mao.

Mao says the way an object comes in contact with the edge of the metamaterial changes the geometry of the material's structure, and therefore how the material responds to stress at the edge. But metamaterial's topological protection allows the inside of the metamaterial remains damage free.

The material could one day be used to build cars or rocket launch systems. In cars, the material could help absorb impacts from a crash.

""When you're driving a car, you want the car to be stiff and to support a load,"" Mao said. ""During a collision, you want components to become softer to absorb the energy from the collision and protect the passenger in the car.""

The researchers also suggest the material could be used to make bicycle tires that could self-adjust to ride more easily on soft surfaces such as sand, or to make damage-resistant, reusable rockets.

Purpose-grown feedstocks (used to extract oils) for biodiesels are controversial because of their cost and the demand they place on land and water. Spent coffee grounds, which have a high calorific value, offer a good low-cost alternative feedstock. However, most used coffee grounds are currently just dumped. In 2014 more than nine million tonnes of spent coffee grounds were sent to landfill.

Although a small number of businesses are using spent coffee grounds to make biofuels, researchers at Lancaster University have found a way to significantly improve the efficiency of the process- vastly increasing biofuel from coffee's commercial competitiveness.

The chemical engineers have consolidated the existing multi-stage process into one step (known as in-situ transesterification), which combines extraction of the oils from the spent coffee grounds and the conversion of it into coffee biodiesel.

In the traditional process, manufacturers mix spent coffee grounds with hexane and cook the mixture at 60degC for between 1-2 hours. The hexane is then evaporated to leave behind the oils. Methanol and a catalyst is then added to make biodiesel, and a glycerol by-product - which also needs separating.

Lancaster University researchers, led by Dr Vesna Najdanovic-Visak, found they are able to combine the processes by using just methanol and a catalyst - removing the need for hexane altogether and saving on chemical waste. In addition, they also discovered that the optimal time for the process was 10 minutes to gain the same yield of oils from the spent coffee grounds - a significant reduction in time needed and associated energy costs.

""Our method vastly reduces the time and cost needed to extract the oils for biofuel making spent coffee grounds a much more commercially competitive source of fuel,"" said Dr Najdanovic-Visak, Lecturer in Lancaster University's Engineering Department. ""A huge amount of spent coffee grounds, which are currently just being dumped in landfill, could now be used to bring significant environmental benefits over diesel from fossil fuel sources.""

The process has the potential to enable 720,000 tonnes of biodiesel to be produced each year from spent coffee grounds.

The work, reported in the paper 'Kinetics of extraction and in situ transesterification of oils from spent coffee grounds' has been published by the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.

In 2014 more than nine million tonnes of spent coffee grounds were sent to landfill.<br><br>Although a small number of businesses are using spent coffee grounds to make biofuels, researchers at Lancaster University have found a way to significantly improve the efficiency of the process- vastly increasing biofuel from coffee's commercial competitiveness.<br><br>The chemical engineers have consolidated the existing multi-stage process into one step (known as in-situ transesterification), which combines extraction of the oils from the spent coffee grounds and the conversion of it into coffee biodiesel.<br><br>In the traditional process, manufacturers mix spent coffee grounds with hexane and cook the mixture at 60degC for between 1-2 hours. The hexane is then evaporated to leave behind the oils. Methanol and a catalyst is then added to make biodiesel, and a glycerol by-product - which also needs separating.<br><br>Lancaster University researchers, led by Dr Vesna Najdanovic-Visak, found they are able to combine the processes by using just methanol and a catalyst - removing the need for hexane altogether and saving on chemical waste. In addition, they also discovered that the optimal time for the process was 10 minutes to gain the same yield of oils from the spent coffee grounds - a significant reduction in time needed and associated energy costs.<br><br>""Our method vastly reduces the time and cost needed to extract the oils for biofuel making spent coffee grounds a much more commercially competitive source of fuel,"" said Dr Najdanovic-Visak, Lecturer in Lancaster University's Engineering Department. ""A huge amount of spent coffee grounds, which are currently just being dumped in landfill, could now be used to bring significant environmental benefits over diesel from fossil fuel sources.""<br><br>The process has the potential to enable 720,000 tonnes of biodiesel to be produced each year from spent coffee grounds.<br><br>The work, reported in the paper 'Kinetics of extraction and in situ transesterification of oils from spent coffee grounds' has been published by the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.<br><br>The papers authors are Vesna Najdanovic-Visak, Florence Yee-Lam Lee, Marcia Tavares and Alona Armstrong, all of Lancaster University.<br><br>Source: Lancaster University </div>"

Scientists had long theorized that tubular plasma structures populated the magnetosphere, but thanks to the work of a group of astronomers in Australia, they now say this with certainty.

The tubes were discovered by probing the magnetosphere -- the region that contains the Earth's magnetic field -- with a radio telescope-turned 3-D camera.

""The discovery of the structures is important because they cause unwanted signal distortions that could, as one example, affect our civilian and military satellite-based navigation systems. So we need to understand them,"" Cleo Loi, an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney, said in a press release.

The magnetosphere structures occupy the region where the atmosphere ends and space begins. The area is rich in plasma, the product of Earth's atmosphere being ionized by solar energy. The bottom (or innermost) layer of the magnetosphere is called the ionosphere. Above the ionosphere is the plasmasphere.

The tubular structures begin in the upper ionosphere and arc through the plasmasphere, where the neutral atmosphere ends and the plasma of outer space begins.

Researchers were able to recognize the structures by turning a radio telescope in Australia into a 3-D movie-maker. They did this by disconnecting the vast array of radio-sensing panels, turning one massive entity into two cooperating but distinct entities.

""This is like turning the telescope into a pair of eyes, and by that we were able to probe the 3D nature of these structures and watch them move around,"" Loi explained.

Loi and her colleagues hope the technique can help them further explore the shapes and behavior of magnetosphere plasma structures in the future.

(Nanowerk News) By observing galaxies billions of light-years away, a team of astronomers has detected tube-like structures mere hundreds of kilometres above the Earth's surface.

""For over 60 years, scientists believed these structures existed but by imaging them for the first time, we've provided visual evidence that they are really there,"" said Cleo Loi of the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics (CAASTRO) at the University of Sydney and lead author of a paper published in Geophysical Research Letters last week (""Real-time imaging of density ducts between the plasmasphere and ionosphere"").

By creatively using a radio telescope to see in 3D, astronomers have detected the existence of tubular plasma structures in the inner layers of the magnetosphere surrounding the Earth.

The astronomers--including Prof. Bryan Gaensler, former director of CAASTRO and the current director of the Dunlap Institute at the University of Toronto--made their observations with the Murchison Widefield Array. The MWA is a radio telescope in Western Australia designed to observe the early Universe and distant galaxies, as well as stars and nebulae within our own Milky Way Galaxy.

As light from a galaxy passes through layers in the Earth's magnetosphere, the light's path--and hence the galaxy's apparent position--is altered by variations in density in the layers. The effect is like looking up from the bottom of a swimming pool at the distortions caused by waves on the surface.

Mapping the variations in the positions of multiple radio sources over the course of a night revealed the shape and dimensions of the tube structures. As well, by exploiting the MWA's rapid ""snapshot"" capabilities, Loi and her colleagues created a movie--effectively capturing the real-time motions of the tubes.

According to Gaensler, ""We were trying to understand if the motions of the ionosphere were random or had a pattern, both to see if the MWA could be used to study the ionosphere, and also to be able to correct for its effect and study the sources behind it.""

In addition, the astronomers made their observations using the east and west halves of the MWA's array of antennas as separate instruments. ""This is like turning the telescope into a pair of eyes, and by doing that we were able to probe the 3D nature of these structures and watch them move around,"" said Loi.

The observations revealed that the tubes above the MWA are 500 to 700 km above the surface and are aligned with the Earth's magnetic field. The tubes are at an angle to the surface because they follow the field as it angles down into the planet.",1.0,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0,Distant radio galaxies reveal hidden structures right above our heads (w/video),"Distant radio galaxies reveal hidden structures right above our heads (w/video)

Medicine, Health Care Cell Chat: Attacking Disease by...

Breakthrough lab-on-a-chip technology that reveals how human cells communicate could lead to new treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders.

Developed by an Australian-Swiss research team, the technology offers researchers unprecedented insights into how individual cells behave - something that scientists are discovering is far more complex than previously thought.

The researchers from RMIT University, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Lausanne joined forces to build a miniature biosensor that allows scientists to isolate single cells, analyse them in real time and observe their complex signalling behaviour without disturbing their environment.

Distinguished Professor Arnan Mitchell, Director of RMIT's MicroNano Research Facility, said single cell analysis held great promise for developing new treatments for diseases but a lack of effective analysis technologies was holding back research in the field.

""We know a lot about how groups of cells communicate to fight disease or respond to infections but we still have a lot to learn about individual cells,"" Mitchell said.

""Studies have recently shown that you can take two cells of the same type and give them the same treatment but they will respond very differently.

Human cells communicate that something is wrong in complex and dynamic ways, producing various chemical substances that signal to other cells what they need to do. When an infection is detected, for example, white blood cells will spring into action and release special proteins to fight and eliminate the intruders.

Understanding how individual cells interact and communicate is critical to developing new therapies for serious diseases, to better harness the power of the body's own immune system or precisely target defective cells.

In a paper published in the high-impact journal Small, the research team demonstrate how the technology can be used to examine the secretion of cytokines from single lymphoma cells.

Cytokines are small proteins produced by a broad range of cells to communicate to other cells, and they are known to play an important role in responses to infection, immune disorders, inflammation, sepsis and cancer.

The study found the lymphoma cells produced cytokine in different ways, unique to each cell, enabling researchers to determine each cell's ""secretion fingerprints"".

""If we can build up a clear picture of this behaviour, this would help us sort good cells from bad and enable us to one day develop treatments that precisely target just those bad cells,"" Mitchell said.

How it works

The biosensor is the latest adaptation of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology developed in RMIT's MicroNano Research Facility.

A microfluidic chip contains tiny channels, pumps and processors, enabling precise and flexible manipulation of fluids. Essentially, microfluidics does for fluids what microelectronics does for information - integrating vast quantities of tiny processing elements into a small chip that is portable, fast and can be produced quickly and efficiently.

The new cost-effective and scaleable technology is lightweight and portable, combining microfluidics with nanophotonics.

Compatible with traditional microscopes, the biosensor is a thin glass slide coated with a gold film, perforated with billions of tiny nanoholes arranged in a specific pattern. These nanoholes transmit a single colour of light, due to an optical phenomena known as the plasmonic effect.

By observing the colour transmitted, researchers can determine the presence of minute quantities of specific chemicals on a slide without any external labels. This detection method enables the continuous monitoring of the chemicals produced from a single cell in real time.

The nanophotonic sensor is coupled to a microfluidic integrated circuit with fluid channels about the size of a human hair. The circuit includes valves to isolate the cell and concentrate its secretions, and systems to regulate the temperature and humidity to sustain the cell.

The work is a collaboration between the laboratory of Bionanophotonic Systems at EPFL, Switzerland, the Integrated Photonics and Applications Centre in the School of Engineering at RMIT and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Switzerland.

RMIT microfluidic chips have been pivotal in enabling research across a range of areas - from water quality monitoring to the development of point-of-care blood tests for suspected heart attacks that could deliver results while a patient is still in an ambulance.

Breakthrough lab-on-a-chip technology that reveals how human cells communicate could lead to new treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders.

Developed by an Australian-Swiss research team, the technology offers researchers unprecedented insights into how individual cells behave - something that scientists are discovering is far more complex than previously thought.

The researchers from RMIT University, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Lausanne joined forces to build a miniature biosensor that allows scientists to isolate single cells, analyse them in real time and observe their complex signalling behaviour without disturbing their environment.

Distinguished Professor Arnan Mitchell, Director of RMIT's MicroNano Research Facility, said single cell analysis held great promise for developing new treatments for diseases but a lack of effective analysis technologies was holding back research in the field.

""We know a lot about how groups of cells communicate to fight disease or respond to infections but we still have a lot to learn about individual cells,"" Mitchell said.

""Studies have recently shown that you can take two cells of the same type and give them the same treatment but they will respond very differently.

""We don't know enough about the underlying mechanisms to understand why this happens and we don't have the right technologies to help scientists figure it out.

""Our solution to this challenge is a complete package - an integrated optofluidic biosensor that can isolate single cells and monitor the chemicals they produce in real-time over at least 12 hours.

""It's a powerful new tool that will give us a deeper fundamental understanding of cell communication and behaviour. These insights will open the way to develop radically new methods for diagnosing and treating disease.""

Cells are the ultimate ensemble cast members, but they can also deliver soliloquies--if the cells ever get the chance to have the stage to themselves. To give individual cells their turn in the spotlight, an international team of scientists has built a sort of microfluidic theatre, complete with a gold-coated glass stage and a nanoplasmonic lighting system.

With the right stage management, individual cells can be induced to reveal their innermost motivations, the signals they would transmit to other cells while playing their parts--heroic or otherwise--in dramas as varied as infection, immune disorders, inflammation, sepsis, and cancer. By listening intently to cells and designing the appropriate therapeutic interventions, scientists may be able to direct cellular actors toward happier endings.

That's the hope that has been expressed by scientists based at RMIT University in Australia, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL), and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Lausanne. These scientists reported that they have developed an optofluidic device that contains a chamber that is around one one-thousandth the size of a raindrop.

The chamber accepts a single cell, which may then be observed in real time while its environment remains undisturbed by molecular labels, which are common in other venues such as fluorescence- and colorimetric-based systems, and which tend to interfere with cell integrity and compromise temporal resolution. Without these distractions, a cell's chemical secretions come through more clearly and continuously.

Details appeared May 28 in the journal small, in an article entitled ""Label-Free Optofluidic Nanobiosensor Enables Real-Time Analysis of Single-Cell Cytokine Secretion."" This article describes what happened after the cellular casting call went out to single lymphoma cells, which were evaluated for cytokine secretion, which the scientists noted, must be monitored if the heterogeneity of cellular functionalities is to be understood, and if novel therapies for multiple diseases are to be developed.

""An innovative label-free optofluidic nanoplasmonic biosensor is introduced for single-cell analysis in real time,"" the article's authors wrote. ""The nanobiosensor incorporates a novel design of a multifunctional microfluidic system with small volume microchamber and regulation channels for reliable monitoring of cytokine secretion from individual cells for hours.""

The biosensor was shown to work for 12 hours straight, but it could, the authors argued, function much longer, offering researchers a powerful and innovative selection tool.

""Different interleukin-2 secretion profiles are detected and distinguished from single lymphoma cells,"" the article continued. ""The sensor configuration combined with optical spectroscopic imaging further allows us to determine the spatial single-cell secretion fingerprints in real time.""

The nanophotonic biosensor developed by the researchers is a glass slide coated with a thin gold film, perforated with billions of nanopores arranged in a precise pattern. A small chamber, whose walls are made of porous membranes, is placed above the slide. The chamber receives a steady flow of water and nutrients through tiny microfluidic channels. Temperature and humidity are carefully regulated. The device contains valves that let scientists insert a cell into the chamber, in which ligands or antibodies are positioned to recognize and capture specific molecules secreted by the cell.

A broadband light source shines on the chamber. Thanks to an optical phenomenon called plasmons, the nanopores let only one light-wave frequency or color through. When a cell secretes a molecule, it attaches to the antibodies, thereby changing the frequency transmitted by the nanopores. This is how minutes of specific molecules can be identified.

Developed by the Australian-Swiss research team, the technology offers researchers unprecedented insights into how individual cells behave--something that scientists are discovering is far more complex than previously thought.

By listening intently to cells and designing the appropriate therapeutic interventions, scientists may be able to direct cellular actors toward happier endings.<br><br>That's the hope that has been expressed by scientists based at RMIT University in Australia, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL), and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Lausanne. These scientists reported that they have developed an optofluidic device that contains a chamber that is around one one-thousandth the size of a raindrop.<br><br>The chamber accepts a single cell, which may then be observed in real time while its environment remains undisturbed by molecular labels, which are common in other venues such as fluorescence- and colorimetric-based systems, and which tend to interfere with cell integrity and compromise temporal resolution. Without these distractions, a cell's chemical secretions come through more clearly and continuously.<br><br>Details appeared May 28 in the journal small, in an article entitled ""Label-Free Optofluidic Nanobiosensor Enables Real-Time Analysis of Single-Cell Cytokine Secretion."" This article describes what happened after the cellular casting call went out to single lymphoma cells, which were evaluated for cytokine secretion, which the scientists noted, must be monitored if the heterogeneity of cellular functionalities is to be understood, and if novel therapies for multiple diseases are to be developed.<br><br>""An innovative label-free optofluidic nanoplasmonic biosensor is introduced for single-cell analysis in real time,"" the article's authors wrote. ""The nanobiosensor incorporates a novel design of a multifunctional microfluidic system with small volume microchamber and regulation channels for reliable monitoring of cytokine secretion from individual cells for hours.""<br><br>The biosensor was shown to work for 12 hours straight, but it could, the authors argued, function much longer, offering researchers a powerful and innovative selection tool.<br><br>""Different interleukin-2 secretion profiles are detected and distinguished from single lymphoma cells,"" the article continued. ""The sensor configuration combined with optical spectroscopic imaging further allows us to determine the spatial single-cell secretion fingerprints in real time.""<br><br>The nanophotonic biosensor developed by the researchers is a glass slide coated with a thin gold film, perforated with billions of nanopores arranged in a precise pattern. A small chamber, whose walls are made of porous membranes, is placed above the slide. The chamber receives a steady flow of water and nutrients through tiny microfluidic channels. Temperature and humidity are carefully regulated. The device contains valves that let scientists insert a cell into the chamber, in which ligands or antibodies are positioned to recognize and capture specific molecules secreted by the cell.<br><br>A broadband light source shines on the chamber. Thanks to an optical phenomenon called plasmons, the nanopores let only one light-wave frequency or color through. When a cell secretes a molecule, it attaches to the antibodies, thereby changing the frequency transmitted by the nanopores. This is how minutes of specific molecules can be identified.<br><br>Developed by the Australian-Swiss research team, the technology offers researchers unprecedented insights into how individual cells behave--something that scientists are discovering is far more complex than previously thought.<br><br>""We know a lot about how groups of cells communicate to fight disease or respond to infections but we still have a lot to learn about individual cells,"" said Arnan Mitchell, Ph.D., director of RMIT's MicroNano Research Facility. ""Studies have recently shown that you can take two cells of the same type and give them the same treatment, but they will respond very differently.<br><br>""We don't know enough about the underlying mechanisms to understand why this happens and we don't have the right technologies to help scientists figure it out. Our solution to this challenge is a complete package--an integrated optofluidic biosensor that can isolate single cells and monitor the chemicals they produce in real-time over at least 12 hours.<br><br>""It's a powerful new tool that will give us a deeper fundamental understanding of cell communication and behavior. These insights will open the way to develop radically new methods for diagnosing and treating disease.""<br><br>Human cells communicate that something is wrong in complex and dynamic ways, producing various chemical substances that signal to other cells what they need to do. When an infection is detected, for example, white blood cells will spring into action and release special proteins to fight and eliminate the intruders.<br><br>Understanding how individual cells interact and communicate is critical to developing new therapies for serious diseases, to better harness the power of the body's own immune system or precisely target defective cells.<br><br>The new biosensor has many potential applications. For example, it could be used to identify the most aggressive cancer cells in a tumor and decide exactly which treatment to administer to the patient.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>"

Company receives FDA 510(k) clearance for use of COHERE(r) interbody in XLIF(r) procedure as new clinical study further validates important benefits of Porous PEEK(tm) material technologyNews provided byNov 08, 2018, 16:05 ETShare this articleSAN DIEGO, Nov. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally integrated solutions, today announced it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use of its COHERE(r) Porous PEEK(tm) implant in eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion (XLIF(r)) surgical spine procedures. NuVasive's patented Porous PEEK technology offers a unique three-dimensional architecture combined with the radiolucent properties of PEEK. Based on preclinical studies, this porous structure promotes bone ongrowth and ingrowth, which is key to facilitating fusion that leads to better clinical outcomes. This unique, proprietary technology - combined with the radiolucent properties of PEEK - provides increased clarity in postoperative x-rays and imaging, allowing surgeons to more easily assess fusion following procedures.""COHERE XLIF with its one-of-a-kind Porous PEEK technology provides surgeons the best implant for treating patients. It is designed to allow early incorporation of bone into the inter-body spacer, which may lead to the prevention of expulsion and promotion of early fusion which allows a quicker and better way back to an active lifestyle for my patients,"" said Dr. Christopher R. Brown, orthopedic spine surgeon for Duke Health. ""Incorporating COHERE Porous PEEK implants into XLIF procedures keeps imaging characteristics that we all love about PEEK implants intact. COHERE XLIF takes the gold standard of lateral interbody fusion and raises the bar, allowing our patients to receive the best surgery with the best implant possible.""The 510(k) clearance supports the Company's strategic expansion of its Advanced Materials Science(tm) technologies into complementary NuVasive procedures. An abstract recently published by Biomaterials, further validates that Porous PEEK implant surfaces provide a stronger osseointegration response than smooth PEEK surfaces. The conclusion is based on results from an in vitro cell study and in vivo small animal model.""It's exciting to extend our patented interbody technology to the Company's flagship XLIF procedure, an integral part of our single-position surgery portfolio, as we further our mission to improve patient lives,"" said Matt Link, president, Strategy, Technology and Corporate Development for NuVasive. ""COHERE XLIF represents the first buildout of a Porous PEEK implant by NuVasive, and we look forward to extending this proprietary technology into additional applications across the Company's comprehensive procedural solutions.""The FDA 510(k) indications for COHERE allow surgeons to use the interbody implant with autograft and/or allograft in skeletally mature patients for thoracolumbar pathologies including degenerative disc disease, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and degenerative scoliosis. NuVasive worked alongside highly experienced XLIF surgeons to pioneer the design of the COHERE XLIF implant to achieve the optimal shape and geometry for lateral insertion.COHERE XLIF is expected to launch commercially in the U.S. in second quarter 2019.

Shinya Yamanaka, a scientist at Kyoto University, loved stem-cell research. But he didn't want to destroy embryos. So he figured out a way around the problem. In a paper published five years ago in Cell, Yamanaka and six colleagues showed how ""induced pluripotent stem cells"" could be derived from adult cells and potentially substituted, in research and therapy, for embryonic stem cells. Today, that discovery earned him a Nobel Prize, shared with British scientist John Gurdon. But the prize announcement and much of the media coverage missed half the story. Yamanaka's venture wasn't just an experiment. It was a moral project.

In the introduction to their Cell paper, Yamanaka and his colleagues outlined their reasons for seeking an alternative to conventional embryonic stem-cell research. ""Ethical controversies"" came first in their analysis. Technical reasons--the difficulty of making patient-specific embryonic stem cells--came second. After the paper's publication, Yamanaka told a personal story, related by the New York Times:

Inspiration can appear in unexpected places. Dr. Shinya Yamanaka found it while looking through a microscope at a friend's fertility clinic. ... [H]e looked down the microscope at one of the human embryos stored at the clinic. The glimpse changed his scientific career. ""When I saw the embryo, I suddenly realized there was such a small difference between it and my daughters,"" said Dr. Yamanaka. ... ""I thought, we can't keep destroying embryos for our research. There must be another way.""

Yamanaka's misgivings weren't absolute. In 2009, when President Obama lifted the U.S. ban on federal funding of embryo-destructive stem-cell research, Yamanaka attended the ceremony to show his support. Yamanaka explained his ambivalence to New Scientist in December 2007. ""Patients' lives are more important than embryos,"" he said. But ""I do want to avoid the use of embryos if possible.""

From September 2009 to June 2012, Yamanaka won three major international science prizes. Each citation recognized the moral significance of his work. In 2009, the Lasker Foundation selected him for its prestigious medical research award, noting that his technique overcame ""the controversy that accompanies methods based on embryonic stem cells."" In 2010, the Inamori Foundation awarded him the Kyoto Prize, again citing ""ethical concerns"" that had burdened previous embryonic stem-cell research. In 2012, the Technology Academy of Finland gave him its Millennium Technology Prize, explicitly for ""Ethical Stem Cells Research."" The academy praised Yamanaka for making possible ""stem cell research into drugs, treatments and transplants without having to use human embryos.""

The Nobel committee, however, made no mention of Yamanaka's moral achievement. Not in its presentation, not in its press release, not in its interview with the laureate. It credited him only with developing ""new tools"" to study disease and develop therapies. Many reporters took the same approach. In its 600-word story, CNN ignored the ethics of Yamanaka's work. The Los Angeles Times called restrictions on embryo destruction mere ""headaches"" for scientists. The New York Times said Yamanaka's work, like other stem-cell technologies, had ""generated objections from people who fear, on ethical or religious grounds, that scientists are pressing too far into nature's mysteries and the ability to create life artificially.""

That's completely wrong. Even before Yamanaka's landmark paper, pro-lifers were all over his work. They loved it. The Vatican had followed his research with interest for years. When Cell published his paper, a pro-life coalition immediately declared his method ""superior to cloning as a means of obtaining patient-specific pluripotent stem cells."" In a homily distributed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal Rigali declared that Yamanaka's story about looking into a fertility-clinic microscope showed how ""God can use a helpless embryo to change a human heart."" People at the National Right to Life Committee were openly rooting for Yamanaka to win a Nobel.

Now he's won it. And we shouldn't turn away from the moral aspect of this achievement just because it gratifies the conservative side of the old stem-cell debate. Yamanaka transformed that debate forever. He tore down the wall between preserving embryos and saving lives. He did what only a scientist could have done: He made it possible for both sides to win. In the words of Julian Savulescu, an ethicist and supporter of embryonic stem-cell research, Yamanaka ""deserves not only a Nobel Prize for Medicine, but a Nobel Prize for Ethics.""

Congratulations, Dr. Yamanaka. And thank you. From all of us.

BOSTON (December 4, 2017)-Researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine, led by Dr. James E. Schwob, are examining the behavior of adult stem cells within the context of aging and, specifically, the sense of smell. As part of the normal aging process, older adults frequently experience a decline in their olfactory function, resulting in a compromised or complete loss of sense of smell. The loss of sense of smell -- whether as a result of aging, medication, illness or injury -- affects sense of taste; when the sense of smell is intact, it combines with the sense of taste to communicate the flavor of food. Smell loss in older adults reduces quality of life, compromises nutritional status, and puts the health and safety of the elderly at risk.

The focus of the research at Tufts is on enlarging the population of adult stem cells that maintain the sense of smell in young adults, but which deteriorate with aging. The ultimate goal is to identify a pharmaceutical preparation that has that effect.

In a study published in the December 7 issue of Cell Stem Cell, the researchers provide the first evidence that it is possible to regenerate stem cells of the nasal tissue in mice, thus enlarging the population of adult stem cells.

Stem cells are undifferentiated, or unspecialized; they are highly potent and able to generate many different types of cells. Embryonic stem cells can give rise to any cell type in the body, while adult or tissue stem cells have a more limited potency. Adult stem cells are responsible for maintaining the structure of the tissue in which they are found and repairing it after injury. There is evidence that adult stem cells may be able to regenerate in response to injury to tissue as part of a natural healing process.

The team took advantage of that natural healing process. Adult stem cells regenerated in mice with injured nasal tissue. When those adult stem cells were transplanted into other mice, they were able to regenerate all the different cell types in the nasal tissue, also called the olfactory epithelium. This expansion of the stem cell population improved when the researchers swabbed a pharmaceutical preparation into the nose; the drug combination pushed progenitor cells to remain upstream as adult stem cells.

Though the response involved the now-famous Yamanaka factors, the strategy developed by Schwob and his team is more efficient and less complicated than the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) Nobel Prize-winning approach developed by Dr. Shinya Yamanaka. Yamanaka's approach was designed to replace stem cells lost to aging by inducing cells taken from adult tissues to behave like embryonic stem cells, by forcing them to express four genes that are usually expressed in embryonic stem cells.

The research team from Tufts determined that only two of the four factors used by Yamanaka to artificially reprogram adult cells into iPSCs are critical to the process of pushing the olfactory cells to become more stem cell-like.

""We are the first researchers to gain insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for allowing these adult progenitor cells to become more potent. We were intrigued that the process shared such a core similarity with iPSC technology, which provides a potential explanation and natural origin for the mechanism that the scientific community has harnessed to great effect,"" said first author Brian Lin, a Ph.D. graduate of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts and now a postdoctoral fellow at Mass General Hospital.

""The direct restoration of adult stem cells has implications for many types of tissue degeneration associated with aging, though we are several years away from designing actual therapies based on this work. The olfactory epithelium is a singularly powerful model for understanding how tissues regenerate or fail to do so,"" said senior author Jim Schwob, M.D./Ph.D., a professor of Developmental, Molecular Chemical Biology at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.

""If we can restore the population of stem cells in the olfactory epithelium by regenerating them or by administering the right drug as a nasal spray, we may be able to prevent deterioration in the sense of smell,"" he continued.

Hailing Jin, a professor of microbiology and plant pathology in UCR's College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, has been studying the role of sRNAs in plant immunity and disease. Her goal is to develop effective and environmentally friendly strategies to control plant diseases and to secure food production.

During a phenomenon called cross-kingdom RNA interference, some pathogens and plants exchange sRNAs during their interactions with each other. Small RNAs are molecules that regulate biological processes by interfering with gene expression. While pathogens deliver sRNAs into plant cells to suppress host immunity, plants transfer sRNAs into pathogens to inhibit their ability to cause infection. Until now, it remained unknown how small RNAs move across the cellular boundaries between hosts and pathogens.

Jin's team found that during infection with Botrytis cinerea, plant cells package sRNAs inside bubble-like sacs, called exosomes, which are sent out of the plant cells and accumulate near the site of infection. These 'battling bubbles' are taken up by the fungal cells efficiently, where the transferred host sRNAs inhibit the expression of fungal genes needed to cause the disease. The research was performed using Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant widely used as a model species because it is easy to grow and study.

""The discovery of the role of exosomes in cross-kingdom RNA interference will help us develop effective delivery methods to target plant pathogens with artificial sRNAs, with the goal of controlling plant diseases in crops, said Jin, who holds the Cy Mouradick Endowed Chair at UCR and is a member of the university's Institute for Integrative Genome Biology.

Jin said her group is also characterizing the pathogen targets of the protective sRNAs transferred from the plant to help identify new genes involved in pathogen virulence.

PHILADELPHIA -Congenital heart valve defects appear in 2 percent of all live births, making them the most common type of birth defect. While some of these defects have been linked to specific genetic mutations, the majority have no clearly definable genetic cause, suggesting that epigenetic factors - changes in gene expression versus an alteration in the genetic code -- play an important role. Now researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found that the force, or shear, of blood flow against the cells lining the early heart valve sends signals for heart ""cushion"" cells to become fully formed valves. Their findings are published in Developmental Cell.

Heart valves ensure that the beating heart drives blood flow in one direction. As the heart beats continuously over a lifetime, valve function must be flawless. Obstruction of forward flow or backward flow due to a defective valve can result in heart failure. Most serious valve defects are treated surgically, with the original valve able to be repaired and other times it must be replaced. However, in general valve replacements are held off in growing children for as long as possible to avoid outgrowing a valve replaced too early.

Embryonic heart valves develop as large cushions that, during development, reshape and thin to form mature valve leaflets. ""The maturation of these big fluffy cushions into the perfectly fitting leaflets of a mature heart valve is an architectural marvel,"" said senior author Mark Kahn, MD, a professor of Cardiovascular Medicine. ""We showed that shear-responsive KLF2-Wnt protein signaling is the basis of this remodeling.""

Lauren Goddard, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Kahn Lab, found that the protein KLF2 was expressed by the shear-sensing cells that line the primitive valve cushions. KLF2's expression was highest in the regions of the valve that experience the strongest shear forces. Using mouse models, she found that deletion of KLF2 in these cells resulted in large cushions that failed to mature properly. Profiling of the genes expressed by early cardiac cushion cells revealed that loss of KLF2 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the Wnt binding partner, WNT9B, a molecule important in the valve maturation communication path.

Loss of WNT9B in the mouse resulted in defective valve remodeling similar to what happens when KLF2 is deleted, suggesting it is a key downstream target of KLF2. Work done by co-author Julien Vermot from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, an expert in how shear forces determine zebrafish development, demonstrated that expression of the gene for WNT9B is restricted to the cells that govern developing heart valves and is dependent on the shear force of early blood flow. These findings were instrumental in linking shear forces to KLF2-WNT9B signaling during valve remodeling.

This work is the first to demonstrate how blood flow shapes developing heart valves into mature valve leaflets. These studies, say the researchers, predict that even a minor breakdown in the series of precisely orchestrated cell-cell communications required to accurately pass on signals from blood flow may result in subtly defective valves. This idea supports an epigenetic explanation for common congenital valve defects.

But, for Dr. Leonardo Chiappis",0.7272727272727273,1,"Neutrons unlock the secrets of limoncello (Nanowerk News) If youre looking for a liquid to study with neutron scattering, lemon liqueur probably isnt your first thought. But, for Dr. Leonardo Chiappisi, a researcher at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL, France) and the Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin), it was an obvious choice. Im originally from Sicily, he jokes, and limoncello is the best thing to help liven up a dinner.

Limoncello, a cloudy neon-yellow liqueur, is common across southern Italy. People often make it themselves by leaving lemon zest to mature in alcohol for several weeks. Its also a personal favourite of Dr. Chiappisi and the inspiration for a paper that he hopes will help develop new speciality chemicals  especially eco-friendly products using citrus oils.

Limoncello is among a group of liqueurs that experience the so-called ouzo effect, named after ouzo, an anise-flavoured aperitif. Ouzo is normally a clear liqueur, but it turns milky and opaque when water is added, and can stay like that for a long time.

The reason is down to its mix of alcohol, oil and water, and its this mixture that interests scientists  including Dr Chiappisi and his co-author, Dr Isabelle Grillo. Usually oil and water repel each other, and have to be forced to mix by adding a detergent or similar surfactant. In ouzo and similar liqueurs, however, the alcohol keeps the oil and water together unless more water is added.

Its this property of keeping water-repelling chemicals in an emulsion with water that interests the speciality chemicals industry. Theres been an interest in describing the properties of these detergent-free solutions since 2010 because theres no need to add a surfactant, which can be hard to remove afterwards, says Dr. Chiappisi. Studying limoncello, in particular, could help the growing industry in citrus oils for green solvents, environmentally-friendly plastics and insect repellent.

Good quality limoncello is always cloudy. In fact, Dr Chiappisi wouldnt consider drinking a non-opaque one and this cloudiness remains for the life of the bottle. People have previously studied the chemical composition of limoncello, but Dr Chiappisis experiment, published in ACS Omega (""Looking into Limoncello: The Structure of the Italian Liquor Revealed by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering""), is the first to look at the physical composition at the microscopic scale. He discovered that limoncello is formed of tiny oil droplets, around 100 nanometres in radius suspended in an alcohol-water mix.

The physical structure of foods is known to affect their flavour, appearance and shelf life, but its often hard to study at the microscopic scale. To look for these tiny droplets, Dr. Chiappisi aimed a neutron beam at samples of limoncello. The neutron beam leaves the sample at a different angle, and this allows us to reconstruct what the structure looks like, he says.

Dr. Chiappisi chose to use neutron scattering as its one of a few techniques capable of looking at the structure of soft materials, such as limoncello, at a length scale of 1 to 100s of nanometres. Neutron scattering is very sensitive to the number of neutrons in a molecule. While the lemon oil was naturally rich in hydrogen, the team enriched the water and ethanol with deuterium  an isotope of hydrogen with an extra neutron.

Limoncello is served in chilled glasses and should be drunk slowly so it often has time to warm up. To find out whether the physical properties change as the temperature rises, Dr. Chiappisi varied the temperature at which he measured neutron scattering. He also altered the amounts of sugar and water in his limoncello.

Working out the amount of essential oils in his homemade limoncello was easier. He resorted to a commonly-used technique called proton nuclear magnetic resonance to measure the oil content at a molecular level. I wanted to see how much lemon oil was extracted from the lemons, he explains.

To his surprise, neither sugar content nor temperature affected the appearance of limoncello at a microscope scale. However, varying the oil and water content did change how much oil was dissolved in the alcohol-water mix rather than locked up in droplets. When the water content was ~50%, similar to a high-quality shop-bought limoncello, only two thirds of the oil was locked up in droplets. The rest was free to be released as a lemon scent, adding to the appeal of the drink.

Dr Chiappisi hasnt yet solved the question of how alcohol creates these tiny droplets; as he says that will probably take many more years and the contributions of other researchers. Some computer simulations suggest that oil droplets enriched with alcohol have a flexible surface, allowing them to wobble in water. But this is just a hypothesis, he explains.",10.0,0.9090909090909092,2.0,0.1818181818181818,Neutrons unlock the secrets of limoncello,"Neutrons unlock the secrets of limoncello (Nanowerk News) If youre looking for a liquid to study with neutron scattering, lemon liqueur probably isnt your first thought. But, for Dr. Leonardo Chiappisi, a researcher at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL, France) and the Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin), it was an obvious choice. Im originally from Sicily, he jokes, and limoncello is the best thing to help liven up a dinner.

Limoncello, a cloudy neon-yellow liqueur, is common across southern Italy. People often make it themselves by leaving lemon zest to mature in alcohol for several weeks. Its also a personal favourite of Dr. Chiappisi and the inspiration for a paper that he hopes will help develop new speciality chemicals  especially eco-friendly products using citrus oils.

Limoncello is among a group of liqueurs that experience the so-called ouzo effect, named after ouzo, an anise-flavoured aperitif. Ouzo is normally a clear liqueur, but it turns milky and opaque when water is added, and can stay like that for a long time.

The reason is down to its mix of alcohol, oil and water, and its this mixture that interests scientists  including Dr Chiappisi and his co-author, Dr Isabelle Grillo. Usually oil and water repel each other, and have to be forced to mix by adding a detergent or similar surfactant. In ouzo and similar liqueurs, however, the alcohol keeps the oil and water together unless more water is added.

Its this property of keeping water-repelling chemicals in an emulsion with water that interests the speciality chemicals industry. Theres been an interest in describing the properties of these detergent-free solutions since 2010 because theres no need to add a surfactant, which can be hard to remove afterwards, says Dr. Chiappisi. Studying limoncello, in particular, could help the growing industry in citrus oils for green solvents, environmentally-friendly plastics and insect repellent.

Good quality limoncello is always cloudy. In fact, Dr Chiappisi wouldnt consider drinking a non-opaque one and this cloudiness remains for the life of the bottle. People have previously studied the chemical composition of limoncello, but Dr Chiappisis experiment, published in ACS Omega (""Looking into Limoncello: The Structure of the Italian Liquor Revealed by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering""), is the first to look at the physical composition at the microscopic scale. He discovered that limoncello is formed of tiny oil droplets, around 100 nanometres in radius suspended in an alcohol-water mix.

The physical structure of foods is known to affect their flavour, appearance and shelf life, but its often hard to study at the microscopic scale. To look for these tiny droplets, Dr. Chiappisi aimed a neutron beam at samples of limoncello. The neutron beam leaves the sample at a different angle, and this allows us to reconstruct what the structure looks like, he says.

Dr. Chiappisi chose to use neutron scattering as its one of a few techniques capable of looking at the structure of soft materials, such as limoncello, at a length scale of 1 to 100s of nanometres. Neutron scattering is very sensitive to the number of neutrons in a molecule. While the lemon oil was naturally rich in hydrogen, the team enriched the water and ethanol with deuterium  an isotope of hydrogen with an extra neutron.

Limoncello is served in chilled glasses and should be drunk slowly so it often has time to warm up. To find out whether the physical properties change as the temperature rises, Dr. Chiappisi varied the temperature at which he measured neutron scattering. He also altered the amounts of sugar and water in his limoncello.

LOMA LINDA, Calif. (PRWEB) October 24, 2018

Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy doesn't negatively affect patient outcomes, according to a new study by researchers at Loma Linda University Health.

The finding could help ease the concerns of patients and physicians, many of whom have been unsure about the combined procedure compared to other options. At issue is a slight delay needed to coordinate schedules of both surgeons -- one to perform the mastectomy, the other to perform the reconstruction. Doing so can extend the time from diagnosis to the initial surgery.

Researchers, however, found that a delay of less than 120 days for women under 60 did not have a substantial negative effect on patient survival rates. The average delay, they found, was two weeks.

Physicians often recommend IBR to support a patient's mental well-being. A mastectomy by itself can often be performed sooner after a cancer diagnosis, but it leaves a patient's body with a different appearance for several weeks or months before reconstructive surgery is performed.

Sharon Lum, MD, medical director of the Breast Health Center at Loma Linda University Health and lead investigator for the study, said the new finding should lay to rest concerns about a slight delay needed to coordinate care for IBR.

""A major concern when combining plastic surgery with a cancer operation is that these complex operations are more difficult to schedule or result in complications that delay care, such as chemotherapy,"" Lum said. ""Our study shows that while immediate breast reconstruction causes a slight delay in time to mastectomy, it doesn't affect patient outcomes.""

The study, ""Impact of Breast Reconstruction on Time to Definitive Surgical Treatment, Adjuvant Therapy, and Breast Cancer Outcomes,"" was published this month in Annals of Surgical Oncology, the official journal of the Society of Surgical Oncology.

For the study, the team analyzed 10 years of data fr om the California Cancer Registry. Researchers examined data from 2004-2014 for stage 0-III breast cancer patients undergoing a mastectomy. Out of those choosing breast reconstruction, researchers looked at the effects of reconstruction on time to surgery, postop systemic therapy, radiation therapy and overall survival.

While IBR was found to delay time to surgery, its use did not substantially affect time to follow-up treatment or survival outcomes.

Other factors related to the delay needed for IBR included verifying healthcare coverage for the procedure and the patient's individual needs.

""Loma Linda University Health encourages whole person cancer care, which can include immediate breast reconstruction after necessary surgery to remove the cancer,"" said Mark Reeves, MD, PhD, director of the Loma Linda University Cancer Center. ""We now know this approach is safe even if it takes a little extra time to coordinate this complex care.""

Date:10/24/2018

Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy doesnat negatively affect patient outcomes, according to a new study by researchers at Loma Linda University Health.

The finding could help ease the concerns of patients and physicians, many of whom have been unsure about the combined procedure compared to other options. At issue is a slight delay needed to coordinate schedules of both surgeons a one to perform the mastectomy, the other to perform the reconstruction. Doing so can extend the time from diagnosis to the initial surgery.

Researchers, however, found that a delay of less than 120 days for women under 60 did not have a substantial negative effect on patient survival rates. The average delay, they found, was two weeks.

Physicians often recommend IBR to support a patientas mental well-being. A mastectomy by itself can often be performed sooner after a cancer diagnosis, but it leaves a patientas body with a different appearance for several weeks or months before reconstructive surgery is performed.

Sharon Lum, MD, medical director of the Breast Health Center at Loma Linda University Health and lead investigator for the study, said the new finding should lay to rest concerns about a slight delay needed to coordinate care for IBR.

aA major concern when combining plastic surgery with a cancer operation is that these complex operations are more difficult to schedule or result in complications that delay care, such as chemotherapy,a Lum said. aOur study shows that while immediate breast reconstruction causes a slight delay in time to mastectomy, it doesnat affect patient outcomes.a

The study, aImpact of Breast Reconstruction on Time to Definitive Surgical Treatment, Adjuvant Therapy, and Breast Cancer Outcomes,a was published this month in Annals of Surgical Oncology, the official journal of the Society of Surgical Oncology.

For the study, the team analyzed 10 years of data fr?om the California Cancer Registry. Researchers examined data from 2004a2014 for stage 0aIII breast cancer patients undergoing a mastectomy. Out of those choosing breast reconstruction, researchers looked at the effects of reconstruction on time to surgery, postop systemic therapy, radiation therapy and overall survival.

While IBR was found to delay time to surgery, its use did not substantially affect time to follow-up treatment or survival outcomes.

Other factors related to the delay needed for IBR included verifying healthcare coverage for the procedure and the patientas individual needs.

aLoma Linda University Health encourages whole person cancer care, which can include immediate breast reconstruction after necessary surgery to remove the cancer,a said Mark Reeves, MD, PhD, director of the Loma Linda University Cancer Center. aWe now know this approach is safe even if it takes a little extra time to coordinate this complex care.a

Their findings were outlined in a special issue of the Asian Journal of Urology .

In a review of papers published about the process and describing the use of antibodies for diagnostic and research applications in biomedical sciences, the investigators set out to document variations in the way scientists practice immunohistochemical (IHC staining).

""Overall, in our experience as journal editors and manuscript reviewers carefully reviewing at least 1,000 manuscripts we estimate, at a minimum, half of them contained potentially incorrect IHC staining results due to lack of best practice antibody validation,"" says Angelo De Marzo , M.D., Ph.D., professor of pathology, urology and oncology and associate director of cancer research pathology for the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center . ""It's a problem well known among the scientific community, but many journal editors are not checking this step before publishing affected papers,"" De Marzo adds.

According to Karen Sfanos , M.S., Ph.D., first author of the study report and associate professor of pathology, urology and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, IHC is extensively used in research laboratories throughout the world and in clinical pathology laboratories for patient care decision-making. They found that variations were most commonly caused by poor quality and/or lack of proper validation of quality of some antibodies provided by vendors prior to commercialization, and by human error. De Marzo and colleagues are calling for the adoption of industrywide standards for IHC practice that focuses on validation, especially when it comes to human tissue research. Antibodies are blood proteins produced in response to other proteins, called antigens. They are markers for a host of diseases, immune system activities, and reactions to treatments in people and in animal and test tube studies.

At the root of the problem, the researchers say, is a misunderstanding by many investigators and pathologists about the two general classes of antibodies used in IHC staining--clinical grade and research grade. Clinical grade antibodies are highly validated for consistency and reproducibility prior to their use in clinical settings in hospital-based pathology labs, but are limited in number (approximately 500 in use). On the other hand, the great majority of commercially available research grade antibodies used in research laboratories are not held to the same standards of validation as clinical reagents, and the number sold commercially has grown exponentially, with more than 3.8 million different ones available, according to the researchers.

""Results from inaccurate IHC tests published in the scientific literature lead to biased results and call into question the validity of those tests in many research laboratories. Much of our research depends on this even if is not clinical research. Although, it won't kill a person if mouse experiment doesn't turn out okay, there is still a cost. It has been estimated that over $2 billion per year is spent on research antibodies and a significant fraction of this amount, as well as researcher time, gets wasted on unreliable results,"" says De Marzo. ""The problem is so striking it is considered an important aspect of a larger overall problem in biomedical sciences, covered extensively in the press recently, and dubbed the ""reproducibility crisis.""

A cornerstone of scientific research is the ability of investigators to repeat and reproduce findings of colleagues' studies to either affirm or reject them. If there is unknown variation in test materials, it is virtually impossible to know whether scientists are comparing similar results or not.

While there has been a clear increase in vigilance by some commercial vendors regarding antibody validation, Sfanos said, the rapid increase in growth of commercial antibody companies and offerings makes oversight challenging.

The National Institutes of Health and some scientific journals are beginning to require researchers to provide details regarding what antibodies are used by investigators and what standards were used to verify the consistency and purity of these reagents used in their analyses.

""Some journal editors do not appear to realize the depth and extent of the problem. They don't recognize there is a disconnect between the clinical grade antibodies and the research grade and that all commercial antibodies, even clinical grade, need to be validated in the end user's laboratory before applying it to patient or animal samples in research studies,"" says De Marzo.

In their review, the authors provide examples of antibody validations they performed, and they direct readers to a growing wealth of literature and online resources, including a novel antibody validation initiative and scoring system being developed, that can help investigators seeking to validate IHC antibodies and assays.

Their findings were outlined in a special issue of the Asian Journal of Urology .

In a review of papers published about the process and describing the use of antibodies for diagnostic and research applications in biomedical sciences, the investigators set out to document variations in the way scientists practice immunohistochemical (IHC staining).

""Overall, in our experience as journal editors and manuscript reviewers carefully reviewing at least 1,000 manuscripts we estimate, at a minimum, half of them contained potentially incorrect IHC staining results due to lack of best practice antibody validation,"" says Angelo De Marzo , M.D., Ph.D., professor of pathology, urology and oncology and associate director of cancer research pathology for the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center . ""It's a problem well known among the scientific community, but many journal editors are not checking this step before publishing affected papers,"" De Marzo adds.

They don't recognize there is a disconnect between the clinical grade antibodies and the research grade and that all commercial antibodies, even clinical grade, need to be validated in the end user's laboratory before applying it to patient or animal samples in research studies,"" says De Marzo.



In their review, the authors provide examples of antibody validations they performed, and they direct readers to a growing wealth of literature and online resources, including a novel antibody validation initiative and scoring system being developed, that can help investigators seeking to validate IHC antibodies and assays.

""It's a problem well known among the scientific community, but many journal editors are not checking this step before publishing affected papers,"" De Marzo adds.<br><br><br><br>According to Karen Sfanos, M.S., Ph.D., first author of the study report and associate professor of pathology, urology and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, IHC is extensively used in research laboratories throughout the world and in clinical pathology laboratories for patient care decision-making. They found that variations were most commonly caused by poor quality and/or lack of proper validation of quality of some antibodies provided by vendors prior to commercialization, and by human error. De Marzo and colleagues are calling for the adoption of industrywide standards for IHC practice that focuses on validation, especially when it comes to human tissue research. Antibodies are blood proteins produced in response to other proteins, called antigens. They are markers for a host of diseases, immune system activities, and reactions to treatments in people and in animal and test tube studies.<br><br><br><br>At the root of the problem, the researchers say, is a misunderstanding by many investigators and pathologists about the two general classes of antibodies used in IHC staining--clinical grade and research grade. Clinical grade antibodies are highly validated for consistency and reproducibility prior to their use in clinical settings in hospital-based pathology labs, but are limited in number (approximately 500 in use). On the other hand, the great majority of commercially available research grade antibodies used in research laboratories are not held to the same standards of validation as clinical reagents, and the number sold commercially has grown exponentially, with more than 3.8 million different ones available, according to the researchers.<br><br><br><br>""Results from inaccurate IHC tests published in the scientific literature lead to biased results and call into question the validity of those tests in many research laboratories. Much of our research depends on this even if is not clinical research. Although, it won't kill a person if mouse experiment doesn't turn out okay, there is still a cost. It has been estimated that over $2 billion per year is spent on research antibodies and a significant fraction of this amount, as well as researcher time, gets wasted on unreliable results,"" says De Marzo. ""The problem is so striking it is considered an important aspect of a larger overall problem in biomedical sciences, covered extensively in the press recently, and dubbed the ""reproducibility crisis.""<br><br><br><br>A cornerstone of scientific research is the ability of investigators to repeat and reproduce findings of colleagues' studies to either affirm or reject them. If there is unknown variation in test materials, it is virtually impossible to know whether scientists are comparing similar results or not.<br><br><br><br>While there has been a clear increase in vigilance by some commercial vendors regarding antibody validation, Sfanos said, the rapid increase in growth of commercial antibody companies and offerings makes oversight challenging.<br><br><br><br>The National Institutes of Health and some scientific journals are beginning to require researchers to provide details regarding what antibodies are used by investigators and what standards were used to verify the consistency and purity of these reagents used in their analyses.<br><br><br><br>""Some journal editors do not appear to realize the depth and extent of the problem.

A stamp from tiny pen quills

There have been other attempts in recent years to print electronic surfaces using inkjet printing and rubber stamping techniques, but with fuzzy results. Because such techniques are difficult to control at very small scales, they tend to produce ""coffee ring"" patterns where ink spills over the borders, or uneven prints that can lead to incomplete circuits.

""There are critical limitations to existing printing processes in the control they have over the feature size and thickness of the layer that's printed,"" Hart says. ""For something like a transistor or thin film with particular electrical or optical properties, those characteristics are very important.""

Hart and his team sought to print electronics much more precisely, by designing ""nanoporous"" stamps. (Imagine a stamp that's more spongy than rubber and shrunk to the size of a pinky fingernail, with patterned features that are much smaller than the width of a human hair.) They reasoned that the stamp should be porous, to allow a solution of nanoparticles, or ""ink,"" to flow uniformly through the stamp and onto whatever surface is to be printed. Designed in this way, the stamp should achieve much higher resolution than conventional rubber stamp printing, referred to as flexography.

Kim and Hart hit upon the perfect material to create their highly detailed stamp: carbon nanotubes -- strong, microscopic sheets of carbon atoms, arranged in cylinders. Hart's group has specialized in growing forests of vertically aligned nanotubes in carefully controlled patterns that can be engineered into highly detailed stamps.

""It's somewhat serendipitous that the solution to high-resolution printing of electronics leverages our background in making carbon nanotubes for many years,"" Hart says. ""The forests of carbon nanotubes can transfer ink onto a surface like massive numbers of tiny pen quills.""

Printing circuits, roll by roll

To make their stamps, the researchers used the group's previously developed techniques to grow the carbon nanotubes on a surface of silicon in various patterns, including honeycomb-like hexagons and flower-shaped designs. They coated the nanotubes with a thin polymer layer (developed by Gleason's group) to ensure the ink would penetrate throughout the nanotube forest and the nanotubes would not shrink after the ink was stamped. Then they infused the stamp with a small volume of electronic ink containing nanoparticles such as silver, zinc oxide, or semiconductor quantum dots.

The key to printing tiny, precise, high-resolution patterns is in the amount of pressure applied to stamp the ink. The team developed a model to predict the amount of force necessary to stamp an even layer of ink onto a substrate, given the roughness of both the stamp and the substrate, and the concentration of nanoparticles in the ink.

To scale up the process, Mariappan built a printing machine, including a motorized roller, and attached to it various flexible substrates. The researchers fixed each stamp onto a platform attached to a spring, which they used to control the force used to press the stamp against the substrate.

""This would be a continuous industrial process, where you would have a stamp, and a roller on which you'd have a substrate you want to print on, like a spool of plastic film or specialized paper for electronics,"" Hart says. ""We found, limited by the motor we used in the printing system, we could print at 200 millimeters per second, continuously, which is already competitive with the rates of industrial printing technologies. This, combined with a tenfold improvement in the printing resolution that we demonstrated, is encouraging.""

After stamping ink patterns of various designs, the team tested the printed patterns' electrical conductivity. After annealing, or heating, the designs after stamping -- a common step in activating electronic features -- the printed patterns were indeed highly conductive, and could serve, for example, as high-performance transparent electrodes.

Going forward, Hart and his team plan to pursue the possibility of fully printed electronics.

""Another exciting next step is the integration of our printing technologies with 2-D materials, such as graphene, which together could enable new, ultrathin electronic and energy conversion devices,"" Hart says.

However, as part of a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory bioenergy study, project scientist Jennifer Pett-Ridge and collaborators have learned how the digestive system of a wood-eating beetle serves as a natural mini-reactor for biofuel production.

Led by Javier A. Ceja-Navarro from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL), the team looked at the microorganisms living within the digestive tract of '""Horned passalus"" beetles (Odontotaenius disjunctus), which live in fallen logs (harvested in Louisiana from fallen pecan tree logs) and are ""subsocial"" -- living in colonies within the wood. These beetles, which are common throughout the Eastern U.S., are responsible for decomposing a huge amount of wood and transforming it into soil organic matter, which contributes to the health and nutrient stock in forest soils. The fact that these beetles can live on food (wood) that is very poor quality -- comprised mainly of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, with very little nitrogen -- is thought to be linked to the capabilities of the bacteria and fungi that reside within their digestive system.

""Understanding how the gut microbiome populations interact to deconstruct lignocellulosic materials to sugars or potential biofuels such as hydrogen and methane could potentially aid in the optimization of industrial cellulosic degradation,"" said LLNL biogeochemist Jennifer Pett-Ridge, a co-author on a paper appearing in the March 11 edition of the journal Nature Microbiology.

The beetle processes large amounts of woody biomass and have developed symbiotic relationships with gut microbes to survive on a low-nutrient diet. The microbial community in the beetle's gut provides digestive enzymes that degrade complex polysaccharides and lignin of plant cells. Physically, the gut is highly compartmentalized, resulting in a segmentation of microbial populations and the processes for energy extraction from lignocellulose.

To understand the complex connections that make up the O. disjunctusdigestive system, the team defined the environment in which these organisms interact, identified the location of key species and their genomes, and confirmed the metabolic pathways contributing to their efficient metabolism of lignocellulosic material.

Breaking down lignin and cellulose to make fuel (sugars etc.) is chemically very difficult, as is fermenting it into a usable reduced product (like acetate, methane or hydrogen). The beetle can't do this on its own. It needs a diverse group of bacteria and other microbes in its gut to help. The spatial stratification in the beetle's gut allows for different microenvironments -- some are more acidic, some more anaerobic. Each appears to have a community that sequentially degrades the wood substrates and extracts energy, sharing some products with the beetle host.

""We study them because they are a natural model biorefinery,"" Pett-Ridge said. ""Understanding how evolution has solved the complex lignocellulose to fuel conversation process can help us design better industrial mimics and find novel enzymes or pathways.""

Coarse woody debris makes up a tremendous amount of biomass in forest ecosystems. As a result, several insect groups have evolved to take advantage of this abundant resource, forming specialized wood-feeding guilds. Among the most prominent groups of insects that have specialized in this manner are termites and specific groups of beetles. These groups are considered economically important insects due to the destructive character of some of their members, as example subterranean termites, powderpost beetles, bark beetles and longhorn beetles. These insects are able to perform mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of coarse woody biomass that is critically important to the ecology of these ecosystems. This ability to subsist on woody biomass, is in part due to the symbiotic associations that have evolved between these insects and their gut microorganisms.

""These passalid beetle gut communities represent an excellent model system for determining how microbial communities assemble and partition processes along physicochemical gradients to yield an efficient system that converts lignocelluloses into hydrogen, methane, ethanol and other bioenergy-relevant products,"" Pett-Ridge said.

Insects are critical contributors to ecosystem functioning, and like most living organisms their co-evolution with microbes has been essential to support these functions. While many insects are infamous for wreaking havoc wherever they roam, many thousands of species go quietly about their business, providing important services essential to healthy ecosystems using the innovative biochemistry of their microbiomes.



New research from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) shows how one such beneficial insect common to the Eastern U.S., the long-horned passalid beetle (Odontotaenius disjunctus), has a hardy digestive tract with microbes to thank for turning its woody diet into energy, food for its young, and nutrients for forest growth. These insights into how the beetle and its distinct microbiome have co-evolved provide a roadmap for the production of affordable, nature-derived fuels and bioproducts.



The paper appears today in the journal Nature Microbiology, titled ""Gut anatomical properties and microbial functional assembly promote lignocellulose deconstruction and colony subsistence of a wood-feeding beetle.""



""We found that the beetle's gut is structured to allow unique microbial communities to coexist, allowing each to perform the distinct specific metabolic processes needed to efficiently extract energy from wood,"" said Javier Ceja-Navarro, a Berkeley Lab research scientist and lead author of the paper. ""The energy derived from the wood allows the beetle to sustain itself and its offspring on an otherwise very poor diet.""





Wood-eating beetles provide forests priceless service



In forests throughout the world, coarse woody debris makes up a tremendous amount of biomass that is tough, hard-to-decompose, and nutritionally bankrupt due to its low nitrogen content. For insects like termites and the passalid beetle, decaying wood is the main dietary staple from which they derive energy and nutrients to make their cells and tissues. An adult passalid burrows its one-inch body through decayed wood that has been pre-processed by fungi, speeding up wood decomposition through its feeding activity and making the wood and carbon accessible for other organisms in the ecosystem.



Passalid colonies may have as many as seven adults that can consume over four times their weight in wood per day. This wood passes through the beetle's complex digestive tract and is finally excreted as its waste product, politely termed frass.



""One of the first things we noticed was how much nitrogen the frass contained, three times more than the wood the beetle consumed - this meant the beetle, or actually its microbes, were adding nitrogen,"" said Ceja-Navarro. ""We also noticed how tough plant polymers like lignin and cellulose were disappearing and energy-rich products like acetate were being formed, as well as biofuels like hydrogen, ethanol, and methane. This beetle and its microbes have worked out what scientists around the world are hurrying to optimize - how to efficiently turn woody plant biomass into biofuels and bioproducts.""





Like little factories in the gut



But how? ""We brought together a team of experts and used advanced molecular biology tools, together with spectrometry and tiny sensors to discover that the beetle's gut is made up of specialized compartments, each with a distinct microbiome that work together almost like a factory production line, using unique biochemistry to turn the wood into food and fuel,"" said Eoin Brodie, senior author and Deputy Director of Berkeley Lab's Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division.



""The key innovation that nature has provided here is a way to combine biochemical processes that are otherwise incompatible,"" said Brodie. Some processes for deconstructing lignin require oxygen while others, like fermentation, which provides the beetle's energy source, need an oxygen-free environment. So how does the beetle solve this?



""It turns out that the beetle's gut architecture, such as the length and thickness of its gut walls, has evolved to suit its microbiome so that specific metabolic processes are favored in different gut regions,"" said Ceja-Navarro.



This allows oxygen-requiring reactions to happen in a gut region that is separated from regions where microbes carry out reactions that would be inhibited by oxygen. The team also demonstrated that the beetle gut architecture prevents certain products like hydrogen from escaping in order to favor the production of acetate, a critical energy source not only for the beetle itself, but also for its offspring.



Passalid beetles are considered amongst the most highly subsocial of species, meaning they work together in family units to defend their log tunnel homes and care for their young into adulthood - which probably sounds familiar to most parents. Because the beetle excretes an energy- and nutrient-rich frass on which their offspring feed, now it seems the young also have their parents' microbes to thank. The nutrient-rich products from these insects eventually work their way back into the forest soil, supporting ecosystem productivity - and this study highlights the essential role of the beetle microbiome in that process.



So what's next? Although nature leads the way, we can learn from how beetles compartmentalize biochemistry along a production line and engineer artificial systems to produce bioproducts by mimicking the properties and functions of systems like this beetle gut and its microbiome, according to Ceja-Navarro.

The research, which is published in Th",0.4444444444444444,1,"Plant scientists at the University of Liverpool have revealed new insights into the mechanisms that allow certain plants to conserve water and tolerate drought.

The research, which is published in The Plant Cell, could be used to help produce new crops that can thrive in previously inhospitable, hot and dry regions across the world.

Drought resistant plants, such as cacti, agaves and succulents, make use of an enhanced form of photosynthesis known as crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, to minimise water loss.

Photosynthesis involves taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to convert into sugars using sunlight. Unlike other plants, CAM plants are able to take up CO2 during the cooler night, which reduces water loss, and store captured CO2 as malic acid inside the cell, allowing its use for photosynthesis without water loss during the next day.

CAM photosynthesis is regulated by the plant's internal circadian clock, which allows plants to differentiate and pre-empt day and night and adjust their metabolism accordingly. However, relatively little is known about the exact molecular processes that underpin the optimal timing of CO2 being stored and released in this unique way.

A team of researchers at the University's Institute of Integrative Biology looked at an enzyme of interest called PPCK that is involved in controlling the conversion of CO2 to its overnight stored form (malic acid; the fruit acid that makes apples taste sharp) and back again. They wanted to know whether PPCK is a necessary component for engineering CAM photosynthesis and tested this by switching the PPCK gene off in the succulent CAM plant Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi.

They found that, for CAM to work properly, the cells must switch on PPCK each night driven by their internal circadian clock. When they prevented Kalanchoe from making PPCK at night, the plants could only capture a third of the CO2 captured by the normal plants.

In addition, they found that the plants that were unable to make PPCK each night had alterations in their circadian clock, a surprising finding that suggests metabolites associated with CAM communicate time-of-day information into the plant's central timekeeper.

Dr James Hartwell commented: ""Drought is a key cause of global crop losses, so understanding the mechanisms that some desert-adapted plants have evolved to survive water stress is vital for engineering improved drought tolerance in crop species.

""Our work demonstrates that ongoing efforts to engineer CAM photosynthesis into other plants will need to include PPCK. The unexpected complexity we revealed in the relationship between PPCK, CAM and the circadian clock also highlights the need for continued research into CAM processes before we can fully understand and exploit their ways.""

UBC researchers Jenn Jakobi and Gareth Jones, both Health and Exercise Sciences professors at UBC's Okanagan campus, recently completed a study that examined the methods used to monitor the progressive advancement of Parkinson's disease (PD)-a degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system.

The study compared results from electromyography assessments of leg and arm muscles to basic physical performance tests such as gait speed, balance and hand-grip strength. The results were surprising.

""It became very clear that the hand-grip test was one of the functional tests that proved to be a reliable and valuable test measure,"" says Jakobi. ""The hand-grip test is an easy and conclusive way to test muscle strength decline in this group of people.""

The study involved 23 men and women with PD and 14 people without the disease, all 50 years or older living independently in Kelowna. The participants wore a portable monitoring device to measure muscle activity with the device recording electrical activity of muscles in the arms and legs for approximately eight hours. Participants also underwent three physical function tests-hand-grip, gait and balance-each morning and afternoon.

Jones says the data gleaned from the three physical tests was as conclusive and as informative as the lengthy recordings of muscle activity. And the tests were easier for participants and those administering the experiments.

""The hand-grip dynamometer is a tool that is easily accessible, easy to use, and is reliable,"" says Jones. ""In addition they are readily available to health professionals such as family doctors, community therapists and physiotherapists.""

""It seems these devices have come full circle and are back being used by clinicians,"" adds Jakobi. ""It's a tool that is ideal for Parkinson's patients as you can easily record a decline in an individual's physical strength and function as the disease progresses.""

Patients with PD suffer symptoms like uncontrollable shaking, slowness of movement, and eventually difficulty with balance, coordination and walking. It's important for health care professionals to track early functional decline of Parkinson's patients, says Jakobi. In this way, individual health can be monitored and future falls related to the disease prevented.

According to Statistics Canada more than 67,000 Canadians are living with Parkinson's today, and it is mostly diagnosed in men over the age of 45.

The results were surprising.<br><br>""It became very clear that the hand-grip test was one of the functional tests that proved to be a reliable and valuable test measure,"" says Jakobi. ""The hand-grip test is an easy and conclusive way to test muscle strength decline in this group of people.""<br><br>The study involved 23 men and women with PD and 14 people without the disease, all 50 years or older living independently in Kelowna. The participants wore a portable monitoring device to measure muscle activity with the device recording electrical activity of muscles in the arms and legs for approximately eight hours. Participants also underwent three physical function tests-hand-grip, gait and balance-each morning and afternoon.<br><br>Jones says the data gleaned from the three physical tests was as conclusive and as informative as the lengthy recordings of muscle activity. And the tests were easier for participants and those administering the experiments.<br><br>""The hand-grip dynamometer is a tool that is easily accessible, easy to use, and is reliable,"" says Jones. ""In addition they are readily available to health professionals such as family doctors, community therapists and physiotherapists.""<br><br>""It seems these devices have come full circle and are back being used by clinicians,"" adds Jakobi. ""It's a tool that is ideal for Parkinson's patients as you can easily record a decline in an individual's physical strength and function as the disease progresses.""<br><br>Patients with PD suffer symptoms like uncontrollable shaking, slowness of movement, and eventually difficulty with balance, coordination and walking. It's important for health care professionals to track early functional decline of Parkinson's patients, says Jakobi.

Published: February 5, 2018.

Low muscle strength during the later teen years has been identified as a risk factor for much later onset of the neurological disease known as ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A study at Sahlgrenska Academy, Sweden, published in the Journal of Neurology also links low blood counts at a young age to ALS.

""One should never overstate conclusions from a first-time study - the results need to be repeated - but we still must say that what we have found is noteworthy,"" says Maria Aberg, an associate professor of neurobiology and lead author of the article as well as a physician in Gothenburg.

The researchers studied Swedish military enlistment data for more than 1.8 million (1,819,817) men in the 1968-2005 period as well as data from the Swedish health care register and mortality register. The majority were 18 years old at the time of enlistment. The follow-up time was up to 46 years.

The group included 526 individuals who developed ALS, a disease that usually occurs after age 50 and involves a successive degradation of the nerves that control muscles. There is no cure, and in most cases patients die after two to five years.

The current study confirms the impression that ALS can be associated with a relatively low body mass index (BMI), even at a young age. The differences, however, were not dramatic. Those who developed ALS had an average BMI of 21.1, compared with 21.9 for the group as a whole.

What stood out instead was the finding that ALS could be associated with low blood counts at military enlistment - in other words, a low proportion of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in the blood. A link was also found between ALS and measured muscle strength in the hands, arms and legs at the time of enlistment.

""Those with the lowest muscle strength had a significant risk of getting ALS 30 years later,"" Maria notes.

An additional finding concerned the men's physical condition, which in this study did not appear to be a contributing factor.

""Here we found conflicting data. Some of it indicated that the risk increases if you engage in very strenuous exercise while other data suggested that physical activity may even be preventive. But we saw no increase in risk if a person was physically fit or in less good shape.""

The study itself is not about the cause and effect of various risk factors. The focus has been on identifying and excluding connections in an unusually large body of data.

""This is a much larger study than those previously done with military enlistment data, and consequently we have been able to see new connections,"" Maria says. ""But we have no answers as to why a particular group has lower muscle strength more than 30 years before becoming sick.""

The research, which uses prescription data on painkillers, does support earlier findings that women taking paracetamol during pregnancy are more likely to have children who develop asthma. However, it also suggests that the painkillers are not the cause of this increase.

Researchers say their results, published in the European Respiratory Journal, should give women reassurance to take painkillers during pregnancy when they are prescribed by a doctor.

A Queen Mary University of London study of almost 500,000 women indicates that taking paracetamol or other painkillers during pregnancy is not responsible for increasing the risk of asthma",0.4166666666666667,1,"Read Time:

A Queen Mary University of London study of almost 500,000 women indicates that taking paracetamol or other painkillers during pregnancy is not responsible for increasing the risk of asthma in children.



The research, which uses prescription data on painkillers, does support earlier findings that women taking paracetamol during pregnancy are more likely to have children who develop asthma. However, it also suggests that the painkillers are not the cause of this increase.



Researchers say their results, published in the European Respiratory Journal, should give women reassurance to take painkillers during pregnancy when they are prescribed by a doctor.



The research was led by Seif Shaheen, Professor of Respiratory Epidemiology, from Queen Mary's Blizard Institute, in collaboration with Professor Catarina Almqvist and colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.



Link between paracetamol and asthma



Professor Shaheen was the first scientist to discover a link between paracetamol use during pregnancy and an increase in the risk of asthma in children. He said: ""This link has now been seen in a number of studies in different countries, but until now there has been very little research on use of other painkillers during pregnancy and the subsequent risk of asthma in children.



""We also do not know whether the link between paracetamol and asthma is causal, in other words we don't know whether paracetamol use in pregnancy per se is leading to more asthma, or whether some other factor is at play. The only way to be sure would be to carry out a trial where pregnant women are randomly assigned to either take paracetamol or not, but there are obvious ethical problems with this approach.""



Study involving 492,999 Swedish mothers and their children



To get around this problem, Professor Shaheen and his colleagues studied 492,999 Swedish mothers and their children. They looked at data on prescriptions for different types of painkillers during pregnancy and compared this with rates of asthma diagnosis in the children. They also looked at other data on the mothers, fathers, and any sisters and brothers.



They found that children born to mothers who had been prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy did have an increased risk of asthma, but that the risk was similar when women had been prescribed opioids (such as codeine and tramadol) or migraine medication. For example, the increase in risk for asthma at five years of age was 50 per cent for paracetamol, 42 per cent for codeine and 48 per cent for migraine medication.



Other risk factors



Professor Shaheen explained: ""These different types of painkillers work in different ways, but our results suggest that when women are prescribed them during pregnancy, the associated increases in children's asthma rates are fairly similar for all types.



""Our interpretation of this is that it's less likely that the drugs are responsible for the asthma. Instead, it seems more likely that another factor that we haven't measured is linked to use of these drugs and to asthma risk. For example, women who are taking prescribed painkillers are likely to be suffering from chronic pain.



""Severe pain, and the stress that it causes, have profound effects on the body, including on levels of some hormones, and there is evidence for a link between high levels of mothers' stress in pregnancy and increased risk of asthma in the offspring.



""If that's the case then it's important to manage chronic pain during pregnancy and we should not avoid prescribing painkillers to pregnant women when they are needed. Similarly, women should feel reassured that infrequent use of paracetamol in pregnancy, which is commonly obtained over the counter and is the recommended painkiller to take in pregnancy, is unlikely to cause asthma in their offspring.



""Our study also suggests that a clinical trial of paracetamol during pregnancy, which poses many challenges, is probably not worthwhile.""



Professor Tobias Welte, from Hannover University, Germany, is President of the European Respiratory Society and was not involved in the study. He said: ""Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in pregnancy, so it is important to know whether it might be a cause of childhood asthma. Previous research suggested these two were linked in some way, but this large study suggests that this may not be a simple cause and effect relationship, and this means that paracetamol should be prescribed to pregnant women who need it. However, we also need to continue studying the complex reasons why so many children develop asthma.""

The study",0.2727272727272727,1,"Efforts to end the gender pay gap could be thwarted by the tendency for women to be pessimistic about their earning potential, shows new research from the University's School of Management.

The study finds that women underestimate their earnings prospects, leading to lower expectations and little inclination to push for higher wages or promotion, or seek a better paid position.

Conversely, men consistently overestimate their prospects. When reality fails to live up to their optimistic expectations they are dissatisfied and more likely than women to try to engineer a pay rise or promotion, or change jobs in the pursuit of better pay.

The finding adds to the complex mix of causes of the gender pay gap reported as work, society and family, and calls into question the efficacy of policy measures to address the gap.

The parliamentary Women and Equalities Committee recently criticised the government for failing to implement reforms aimed at eliminating the gender pay gap, which The Office for National Statistics puts at 9.4 per cent for full-time employees in 2016. From 6 April 2017 new gender pay gap regulations will require companies to publish information on the difference between male and female salaries.

Despite being lower paid than men, it's well documented that women are more satisfied at work than their male counterparts. Economists have been trying to explain the 'paradox of the contented female worker', or why women are happy at work despite pay inequality.

Published in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, the findings are based on analysis from the British Household Panel Survey - a major longitudinal study - tracking individuals' expectations of salaries from unemployment to paid employment.

Women underestimate pay prospects

The results suggest men have a tendency to overestimate what they would be paid, while women underestimated their pay prospects, adding to the body of evidence that shows women underestimate their abilities, while men consistently overestimate their capabilities.

Dr Chris Dawson, Senior Lecturer in Business Economics in the School of Management, said: ""If low female expectations in terms of pay is fuelled by a pessimistic outlook, then even without discrimination and progression-related issues, women will continue to underestimate themselves and continue to inadvertently accept pay inequality.

""It has serious implications for policy that is trying to address the gender pay gap and suggests more needs to be done to actively advance women at work, without relying on them to self-select for promotion and senior opportunities. The takeaway message of this research is not about putting the responsibility on women, but recognising that without policy measures to address this, we run the risk of never closing the gender pay gap.""

The role of 'unconscious pessimism'

Professor Veronica Hope Hailey, Dean of the University's School of Management, added: ""Whilst the role of unconscious bias in gender relations in the workplace has been well documented, this new research demonstrates the role of unconscious pessimism and passivity on the part of women. It shows the importance of people management practices that enable and encourage women to progress and recognise their value. The onus is on policy makers and employers to foster female talent so that initiatives to close the gender pay gap can succeed.""

This never before observed coordination may point the way to new tools for studying fungal diseases and provide new clues into how to treat fungal infections, including sometimes deadly systemic infections.

The study (Coordinated host-pathogen transcriptional dynamics revealed using sorted subpopulations and single macrophages infected with Candida albicans) was conducted by a team that includes Reeta Rao, professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI and a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Toni Delorey, a PhD candidate at WPI. Rao and Christine Cuomo, senior group leader at the Broad Institute, are the lead authors.

Fungal diseases, particularly those caused by Candida, a genus prevalent in humans that is responsible for oral thrush, ear infections, and vaginitis, are notoriously difficult to treat. With a 30 to 50 percent mortality rate, systemic Candida infections, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals, are among the leading causes of serious illnesses and death in hospitalized patients.

Because of the lackluster effect of most antifungal medications, scientists study the biology of Candida and its interaction with the mammalian immune system looking for potential vulnerabilities to exploit or possible targets for new drugs. In the current study, Rao and the WPI/Broad Institute team focused on the interaction between a Candida species known as C. albicans, the most common fungal pathogen, and macrophages, immune cells that attack invaders by engulfing and digesting them.

In previous research, Rao and her colleagues found that when populations of C. albicans and macrophages are mixed, the outcomes of their interactions are dynamic and heterogenous. Microscopic observation reveals that macrophages appear to consume and successfully destroy the fungus or consume the fungus but are lysed by fungi that are filamenting, allowing the fungus to escape. In addition, some subpopulations of macrophages are seemingly idle and not pursuing the fungi.

To understand the transcriptional wiring behind these diverse outcomes, the WPI/Broad Institute researchers developed a novel pipeline for studying the host-pathogen responses of individual fungus and macrophage cells over the course of an infection. The technique made it possible, for the first time, to observe and follow changes in gene expression in single host-pathogen pairs as they interact with one another.

They did this by using different fluorescent dyes to mark the C. albicans cells and macrophages, and determined the state of each cell type based on the appearance or disappearance of those colors. For example, C. albicans cells were marked with both red and green fluorescent dyes. A living fungus inside a macrophage would emit both colors. But since the green dye cannot withstand the high pH inside phagosomes, the organelles within macrophages that digest captured microorganisms, dead C. albicans would emit only red light.

Using this tool, the researchers were able to parse four possible infection outcomes: a C. albicans engulfed and killed by a macrophage; a C. albicans engulfed but alive and probably filamenting; a C. albicans near a macrophage, but not engulfed; and a macrophage in the presence of a C. albicans but not engulfing it. They looked for these outcomes at two hours and at four hours after the start of an infection, and observed changes in gene expression in the two cell types.

For example, at two hours, macrophages encountering fungus cells secreted chemicals called cytokines that promote inflammation and also recruit other macrophages. Inflammation helps the body respond to an infection. At this point most of the fungus cells were in the benign ""yeast"" form. The C. albicans engulfed by macrophages expressed genes that enable the fungus to survive inside the macrophage, where it is deprived of glucose, its normal food. Still, most of the fungal cells engulfed at this stage were likely to be killed. At four hours, C. albicans cells that had been engulfed by macrophages were expressing genes for cell wall remodeling and filamentation. In response, the macrophages began secreting a different kind of cytokine, one that serves to reduce inflammation.

""Inflammation is a good thing, initially,"" Rao said. ""But prolonged inflammation is damaging to the body.""

The researchers were especially interested in the population of macrophages that seemed to sit on the sidelines, remaining inactive as other macrophages around them are busy consuming C. albicans. Rao says both cell type (host and pathogen) seem to be following an evolutionary strategy that can best be described as hedging their bets--waiting to see the outcome of the macrophage vs. pathogen battle and standing ready to wade into the fight should the pathogen seem to be winning. In fact, both host and pathogen seem to engage in this strategy, the authors noted in the Nature Communications paper.

""Both cell types may rely on stochastic diversification of phenotypes to improve their survival rate in the event of an encounter with the other cell type,"" they wrote. ""For instance, clonal populations of C. albicans that find themselves in the unpredictable, changing environment of a host phagocyte could increase the chance of survival by varying the expression of key genes involved in the response.""

Rao noted that bet hedging has been observed in populations of pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells, and is associated with drug resistance. This is the first time it has been identified in a pathogenic fungus. She said that a better understanding of the intertwined fates of macrophages and C. albicans could help identify new strategies for treating fungal infections.

""Research like this could point to particular genes to target with drugs, but we know that penetrating the tough cell walls of fungi is difficult,"" she said. ""A better strategy may be to use what we are learning about the evolution of an infection and about bet hedging to modulate the host immune system to make it more effective at combating the infection. For example, it might be possible to modulate the immune system by manipulating the signals that the macrophages send out to more effectively recruit a repertoire of immune cells to attack the invading fungi. I think this is where a lot of exciting new research is going to be done.""

This never before observed coordination may point the way to new tools for studying fungal diseases and provide new clues into how to treat fungal infections, including sometimes deadly systemic infections.

The study (Coordinated host-pathogen transcriptional dynamics revealed using sorted subpopulations and single macrophages infected with Candida albicans) was conducted by a team that includes Reeta Rao, professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI and a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Toni Delorey, a PhD candidate at WPI. Rao and Christine Cuomo, senior group leader at the Broad Institute, are the lead authors.

Fungal diseases, particularly those caused by Candida, a genus prevalent in humans that is responsible for oral thrush, ear infections, and vaginitis, are notoriously difficult to treat. With a 30 to 50 percent mortality rate, systemic Candida infections, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals, are among the leading causes of serious illnesses and death in hospitalized patients.

Because of the lackluster effect of most antifungal medications, scientists study the biology of Candida and its interaction with the mammalian immune system looking for potential vulnerabilities to exploit or possible targets for new drugs. In the current study, Rao and the WPI/Broad Institute team focused on the interaction between a Candida species known as C. albicans, the most common fungal pathogen, and macrophages, immune cells that attack invaders by engulfing and digesting them.

In previous research, Rao and her colleagues found that when populations of C. albicans and macrophages are mixed, the outcomes of their interactions are dynamic and heterogenous. Microscopic observation reveals that macrophages appear to consume and successfully destroy the fungus or consume the fungus but are lysed by fungi that are filamenting, allowing the fungus to escape. In addition, some subpopulations of macrophages are seemingly idle and not pursuing the fungi.

To understand the transcriptional wiring behind these diverse outcomes, the WPI/Broad Institute researchers developed a novel pipeline for studying the host-pathogen responses of individual fungus and macrophage cells over the course of an infection. The technique made it possible, for the first time, to observe and follow changes in gene expression in single host-pathogen pairs as they interact with one another.

They did this by using different fluorescent dyes to mark the C. albicans cells and macrophages, and determined the state of each cell type based on the appearance or disappearance of those colors. For example, C. albicans cells were marked with both red and green fluorescent dyes. A living fungus inside a macrophage would emit both colors. But since the green dye cannot withstand the high pH inside phagosomes, the organelles within macrophages that digest captured microorganisms, dead C. albicans would emit only red light.

Using this tool, the researchers were able to parse four possible infection outcomes: a C. albicans engulfed and killed by a macrophage; a C. albicans engulfed but alive and probably filamenting; a C. albicans near a macrophage, but not engulfed; and a macrophage in the presence of a C. albicans but not engulfing it. They looked for these outcomes at two hours and at four hours after the start of an infection, and observed changes in gene expression in the two cell types.

For example, at two hours, macrophages encountering fungus cells secreted chemicals called cytokines that promote inflammation and also recruit other macrophages. Inflammation helps the body respond to an infection. At this point most of the fungus cells were in the benign ""yeast"" form. The C. albicans engulfed by macrophages expressed genes that enable the fungus to survive inside the macrophage, where it is deprived of glucose, its normal food. Still, most of the fungal cells engulfed at this stage were likely to be killed. At four hours, C. albicans cells that had been engulfed by macrophages were expressing genes for cell wall remodeling and filamentation. In response, the macrophages began secreting a different kind of cytokine, one that serves to reduce inflammation.

A study published in the journal Nature Communications reveals that cells of a fungal pathogen and cells from the host's immune system engage in a tightly coordinated dance of gene expression as the fungus seeks to launch an infection and the host endeavors to protect itself. This never before observed coordination may point the way to new tools for studying fungal diseases and provide new clues into how to treat fungal infections, including sometimes deadly systemic infections.

The study (Coordinated host-pathogen transcriptional dynamics revealed using sorted subpopulations and single macrophages infected with Candida albicans) was conducted by a team that includes Reeta Rao, professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI and a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Toni Delorey, a PhD candidate at WPI. Rao and Christine Cuomo, senior group leader at the Broad Institute, are the lead authors.

Fungal diseases, particularly those caused by Candida, a genus prevalent in humans that is responsible for oral thrush, ear infections, and vaginitis, are notoriously difficult to treat. With a 30 to 50 percent mortality rate, systemic Candida infections, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals, are among the leading causes of serious illnesses and death in hospitalized patients.

Because of the lackluster effect of most antifungal medications, scientists study the biology of Candida and its interaction with the mammalian immune system looking for potential vulnerabilities to exploit or possible targets for new drugs. In the current study, Rao and the WPI/Broad Institute team focused on the interaction between a Candida species known as C. albicans, the most common fungal pathogen, and macrophages, immune cells that attack invaders by engulfing and digesting them.

In previous research, Rao and her colleagues found that when populations of C. albicans and macrophages are mixed, the outcomes of their interactions are dynamic and heterogenous. Microscopic observation reveals that macrophages appear to consume and successfully destroy the fungus or consume the fungus but are lysed by fungi that are filamenting, allowing the fungus to escape. In addition, some subpopulations of macrophages are seemingly idle and not pursuing the fungi.

To understand the transcriptional wiring behind these diverse outcomes, the WPI/Broad Institute researchers developed a novel pipeline for studying the host-pathogen responses of individual fungus and macrophage cells over the course of an infection. The technique made it possible, for the first time, to observe and follow changes in gene expression in single host-pathogen pairs as they interact with one another.

They did this by using different fluorescent dyes to mark the C. albicans cells and macrophages, and determined the state of each cell type based on the appearance or disappearance of those colors. For example, C. albicans cells were marked with both red and green fluorescent dyes. A living fungus inside a macrophage would emit both colors. But since the green dye cannot withstand the high pH inside phagosomes, the organelles within macrophages that digest captured microorganisms, dead C. albicans would emit only red light.

Using this tool, the researchers were able to parse four possible infection outcomes: a C. albicans engulfed and killed by a macrophage; a C. albicans engulfed but alive and probably filamenting; a C. albicans near a macrophage, but not engulfed; and a macrophage in the presence of a C. albicans but not engulfing it. They looked for these outcomes at two hours and at four hours after the start of an infection, and observed changes in gene expression in the two cell types.

For example, at two hours, macrophages encountering fungus cells secreted chemicals called cytokines that promote inflammation and also recruit other macrophages. Inflammation helps the body respond to an infection. At this point most of the fungus cells were in the benign ""yeast"" form. The C. albicans engulfed by macrophages expressed genes that enable the fungus to survive inside the macrophage, where it is deprived of glucose, its normal food. Still, most of the fungal cells engulfed at this stage were likely to be killed. At four hours, C. albicans cells that had been engulfed by macrophages were expressing genes for cell wall remodeling and filamentation. In response, the macrophages began secreting a different kind of cytokine, one that serves to reduce inflammation.

""Inflammation is a good thing, initially,"" Rao said. ""But prolonged inflammation is damaging to the body.""

The researchers were especially interested in the population of macrophages that seemed to sit on the sidelines, remaining inactive as other macrophages around them are busy consuming C. albicans. Rao says both cell type (host and pathogen) seem to be following an evolutionary strategy that can best be described as hedging their bets--waiting to see the outcome of the macrophage vs. pathogen battle and standing ready to wade into the fight should the pathogen seem to be winning. In fact, both host and pathogen seem to engage in this strategy, the authors noted in the Nature Communications paper.

""Both cell types may rely on stochastic diversification of phenotypes to improve their survival rate in the event of an encounter with the other cell type,"" they wrote. ""For instance, clonal populations of C. albicans that find themselves in the unpredictable, changing environment of a host phagocyte could increase the chance of survival by varying the expression of key genes involved in the response.""

Rao noted that bet hedging has been observed in populations of pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells, and is associated with drug resistance. This is the first time it has been identified in a pathogenic fungus. She said that a better understanding of the intertwined fates of macrophages and C. albicans could help identify new strategies for treating fungal infections.

""Research like this could point to particular genes to target with drugs, but we know that penetrating the tough cell walls of fungi is difficult,"" she said. ""A better strategy may be to use what we are learning about the evolution of an infection and about bet hedging to modulate the host immune system to make it more effective at combating the infection. For example, it might be possible to modulate the immune system by manipulating the signals that the macrophages send out to more effectively recruit a repertoire of immune cells to attack the invading fungi. I think this is where a lot of exciting new research is going to be done.""

Researchers at the Boston University Medical Center found that if a person has a sibling who reached an extremely old age, then he or she is more likely to be the same compared to an average person born around the same time. The chances increase as the longevity increases, showing a direct link between genes and living a long life.

The team involved 1,500 participants for the study and focused on 1,900 sibling relationships. The families have at least one person who reached at least 90 years old.

The researchers discovered that if one has a sibling who reached his or her 90th birthday, the chance of that person reaching the same extremely old age is almost twice as high as that of the average person. Those with siblings who recently celebrated their 95th birthday, on the other hand, are 3.5 times more likely to do the same. And if you have one who has been around for a century, then your chance of living that long is nine times higher than that of those who don't have such siblings.

The difference between living to 90 and living past 105 seems to depend largely on genes, according to a study of siblings.

For people who live to 90 years old, the chance of their siblings also reaching age 90 is relatively small--about 1.7 times greater than for the average person born around the same time.

But for people who survive to age 95, the chance of a sibling living to the same age is 3.5 times greater--and for those who live to 100, the chance of a sibling reaching the same age grows to about nine times greater.

At 105 years old, the chance that a sibling will attain the same age is 35 times greater than for people born around the same time--although the authors note that such extreme longevity among siblings is very rare.

""These much higher relative chances of survival likely reflect different and more potent genetic contributions to the rarity of survival being studied, and strongly suggest that survival to age 90 and survival to age 105 are dramatically different phenotypes or conditions, with very different underlying genetic influences,"" the authors write in the study published online in the Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences.

1,900 siblings

Paola Sebastiani, a Boston University School of Public Health professor of biostatistics, and colleagues analyzed survival data from the families of 1,500 participants in the New England Centenarian Study, the largest study of centenarians and their family members in the world, based at Boston Medical Center.

Among those families, the research team looked at more than 1,900 sibling relationships that contained at least one person reaching the age of 90.

Sebastiani and coauthor Thomas Perls, associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine and the centenarian study's founder and lead investigator, say the findings advance the idea that genes play ""a stronger and stronger role in living to these more and more extreme ages"" and that the combinations of longevity-enabling genes that help people survive to 95 years are likely different from those that help people reach the age of 105, who are about 1,000 times rarer in the population.

They say that previous studies of the determinants of survival to older ages have been clouded by researchers not being precise about what they call aging, life span, longevity, or even exceptional longevity.

""For a long time, based upon twin studies in the 1980s and early 1990s, scholars have maintained that 20 to 30 percent of longevity or even life span is due to differences in genes, and that the remainder is due to differences in environment, health-related behaviors, or chance events. But the oldest twins in those studies only got to their mid-to-late 80s,"" says Perls.

""Findings from this and other studies show that genetic makeup explains an increasingly greater portion of the variation in how old people live to be, especially for ages rarer than 100 years.""

[related]

Perls and Sebastiani say there is considerable inconsistency in the gerontological literature concerning definitions of aging, longevity, and life span.

""The casual use of these terms leads to confusing claims regarding heredity and non-replicated genetic studies,"" Perls says. ""Many researchers equate the term 'longevity' with 'old age,' and neither term is adequately specific.""

Because genes play a much stronger differentiating role in living to 105-plus years, studies of such individuals are ""much more powerful in discovering longevity-related genes than studies of people in their 90s,"" he says.

Sebastiani, Perls, and their co-authors call for investigators probing genetic influences to be precise in describing the rarity or percentile of survival that study subjects achieve.

The National Institute on Aging and a pilot study grant from the School of Public Health funded the work.

The research, which used mice, is the first to demonstrate that PQQ has this type of protective effect. PQQ is a naturally occurring antioxidant found in soil and foods, such as soy, parsley, celery, kiwi, and papaya, and is also present in high quantities in human breast milk.

""Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease worldwide, and affects approximately 35 percent of obese children in North America alone. Despite its growing prevalence, no effective treatment exists to date,"" said Karen R. Jonscher, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work at the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, in Aurora, Colorado. ""Our results suggest that supplementation with PQQ, particularly during pregnancy and lactation, might help slow the advancing epidemic of NAFLD in the next generation.""

To make their discovery, Jonscher and colleagues fed mouse mothers a normal diet or one with high amounts of fat, sugar, and cholesterol as is typical of human Western-style diets. The researchers then provided a subset of mice from each diet group with supplemental PQQ in their drinking water. Their offspring were kept on the same diets and PQQ into early adulthood, except for one group that had PQQ supplementation discontinued at weaning (3 weeks of age). Offspring fed the high-fat, -sugar, and -cholesterol diet gained more weight than mice fed a normal diet, and PQQ did not change the amount of weight gain. Those with PQQ supplementation, however, did have less fat in their livers, even before they were born, and PQQ prevented the accumulation of damaging fats in the liver, despite continued consumption of the experimental diet. This was associated with reduced inflammation and was found in the mothers that had only been exposed to PQQ during pregnancy and lactation.

""While this intriguing study leaves open the question of whether the effects are intrauterine or transgenerational-epigenetic in character (or both), the potential relevance to human pre- and postnatal obesity is clear,"" said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal. ""This work sets specific issues in play for follow-up studies.""

Now you can't really deny it.""mengel@nydailynews.com </div>"

The study features data from University Hospitals Case Medical Center Seidman Cancer Center.

The study, the largest of its kind, focused on the impact of 3D mammography at a diverse range of sites across the U.S, looking at nearly half a million mammograms at 13 sites. Key Findings:* 41% increase in invasive cancer detected with 3D mammography* 15% decrease in unnecessary recalls for false alarms* A 29% increase in the detection of all breast cancers

""This study confirms what we already know: 3D mammography finds more of the invasive, harmful cancers we want found and saves women the anxiety and cost of having additional exams for what turns out to be a false alarm,"" said the study's co-author Donna Plecha, MD, Director of Breast Imaging at UH Case Medical Center. ""We already knew that breast screening saves lives and this study provides us with firm data that 3D mammography is a better test for detecting breast cancer early when it is treatable.""

Hologic 3D mammography (breast tomosynthesis) was used exclusively in the study, as they are the only FDA-approved 3D mammography manufacturer. University Hospitals Case Medical Center was involved in the initial research on tomosynthesis and has offered 3D mammography since 2011.

The system combines advanced digital mammography and tomosynthesis-generated images to provide a more detailed, highly focused picture of the breast. These images are then used to produce a series of one-millimeter thick slices that can be viewed as a 3D reconstruction of the breast. Women see little difference between a conventional 2D mammogram and a 3D mammogram. The exam takes just a few seconds longer and the positioning is the same. The real difference is in the information available to the doctor.

The technology gives radiologists the ability to identify and characterize individual breast structures and clearly see features which might be obscured in a traditional 2D mammogram by overlapping normal breast anatomy that may mimic or mask a tumor. Dense tissue and overlapping tissue structures may lead to false positive or false negative results with standard mammography.

Breast cancer is a significant health problem and statistics indicate that one in eight women will develop the disease in her lifetime. The stage at which the cancer is discovered influences a woman's chance of survival and annual mammography after the age of 40 enables physicians to identify the smallest abnormalities. In fact, when breast cancer is detected early and confined to the breast, the five-year survival rate is 97 percent.

""Breast cancers caught in the initial stages by mammography are more likely to be cured and are less likely to require chemotherapy or as extensive surgery,"" said Dr. Plecha, who is also Assistant Professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""This study shows that 3D mammography is a more effective screening tool, and we must make it accessible to all women.""

Traditional mammograms are essentially an x-ray of the breast, according to Cancer.gov. They involve two x-ray images of each breast, used to detect tumors that could not be felt. In women over the age of 50, mammograms have been shown to reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 35 percent, Medical News Today reported. Still the life-saving technology has serious limitations. For example, the 2D pictures can sometimes not pick up cancers hidden in overlapping tissue. They also tend to over-diagnose harmless lesions, and the compression of the breast, which occurs during the procedure is often described as uncomfortable, Medical News Today reported.

When tomosynthesis was added to traditional mammograms, researchers found 41 percent more invasive cancers and reduced the number of women called back for false alarms by 15 percent. Once more, 3D mammography was the only method in breast cancer screening that showed such excellent figures. ""The coming years will be very exciting, as we see further improvements in this innovative technology. This new technology will certainly change the way we screen women,"" Conant concluded in the press release.

There are those who argue that with 3D imaging or without, annual breast exams do not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of a physical examination. A study conducted in Canada looked at 89,935 women randomly assigned to mammography or no mammography. After 25 years, there was no significant difference found in the breast cancer mortality of the two groups of women. However, the researchers did add that the same results may not exist in other countries and ""education, early diagnosis, and excellent clinical care should continue to be provided to women.""

According to the American Cancer Society, about one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. It is the second most common cancer among American women. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, with only lung cancer surpassing it in number. The American Cancer Society estimates that before the year is over about 40,000 women in the Unities States will die from breast cancer. Although the 3D breast imaging test was FDA-approved, it is not yet considered standard and some major insurance carriers will not cover the procedure, The Sun Times reported.

(HealthDay)

TUESDAY, June 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Overweight and obese young adults are twice as likely as those who are thinner to try to control their weight through binging and purging, using laxatives or diuretics, or forcing themselves to vomit, a new study finds.

The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) researchers noted that these unhealthy weight-control methods increase the risk of depression, alcohol and tobacco use, poor nutrition and even significant weight gain.

For the study, the research team analyzed data from more than 14,000 young adults, aged 18 to 24, across the United States.

The findings showed that rates of unhealthy weight-control methods were: 29 percent among obese and overweight women; 16 percent among underweight or normal-weight women; 15 percent among obese and overweight men; and 7.5 percent among underweight or normal-weight men.

Diagnoses of eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, were twice as high among those who were normal weight or underweight. But this finding may be due to under-recognition that these conditions occur in overweight and obese young adults, according to study first author Dr. Jason Nagata.

Nagata is a fellow in the division of adolescent and young adult medicine and the eating disorders program at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals.

""Clinicians and parents should be aware that eating disorders occur in people who are overweight and obese. They should ask if and how young people are trying to lose weight and discourage unsafe practices, which can lead to severe illness and hospitalization,"" Nagata said in a university news release.

According to the study's senior author, Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, ""Young adulthood is a critical developmental period that is distinct from adolescence and older adulthood but, unfortunately, this period has not received sufficient attention within clinical or research circles."" Bibbins-Domingo is a professor of medicine, and also chair of UCSF's department of epidemiology and biostatistics.

""Although they are usually assumed to be healthy, young adults often have poor patterns of health behaviors and are less likely to be engaged in medical care,"" she added.

(HealthDay)

TUESDAY, June 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Overweight and obese young adults are twice as likely as those who are thinner to try to control their weight through binging and purging, using laxatives or diuretics, or forcing themselves to vomit, a new study finds.

The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) researchers noted that these unhealthy weight-control methods increase the risk of depression, alcohol and tobacco use, poor nutrition and even significant weight gain.

For the study, the research team analyzed data from more than 14,000 young adults, aged 18 to 24, across the United States.

The findings showed that rates of unhealthy weight-control methods were: 29 percent among obese and overweight women; 16 percent among underweight or normal-weight women; 15 percent among obese and overweight men; and 7.5 percent among underweight or normal-weight men.

Diagnoses of eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, were twice as high among those who were normal weight or underweight. But this finding may be due to under-recognition that these conditions occur in overweight and obese young adults, according to study first author Dr. Jason Nagata.

Nagata is a fellow in the division of adolescent and young adult medicine and the eating disorders program at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals.

""Clinicians and parents should be aware that eating disorders occur in people who are overweight and obese. They should ask if and how young people are trying to lose weight and discourage unsafe practices, which can lead to severe illness and hospitalization,"" Nagata said in a university news release.

According to the study's senior author, Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, ""Young adulthood is a critical developmental period that is distinct from adolescence and older adulthood but, unfortunately, this period has not received sufficient attention within clinical or research circles."" Bibbins-Domingo is a professor of medicine, and also chair of UCSF's department of epidemiology and biostatistics.

""Although they are usually assumed to be healthy, young adults often have poor patterns of health behaviors and are less likely to be engaged in medical care,"" she added.

The study was published June 12 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

The same is true in equi",0.35,1,"Elite athletes train for years to reach the top of their game. Yet some succumb to temptation, using performance-enhancing drugs to gain a slight edge over their competitors.

The same is true in equine sports. Though the vast majority of competitors come by their success honestly, some horses have been found with all manner of performance-enhancing drugs in their systems, used by unscrupulous trainers or veterinarians to give the animals an unfair advantage over the competition in races and sporting events. By masking the signs of overexertion or injury, such illicit drugs may set up a horse--and its rider--for harm, in addition to compromising the integrity of the sport.

At Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine, researchers and veterinarians work to maintain the welfare of horses involved in sports like racing, jumping, and eventing, while also helping ensure that participants in those events start on an even playing field.

""If horses are treated with something that is covering up an injury or building muscle or bone in an unnatural way, it can predispose them to an injury,"" says Mary Robinson, director of Penn Vet's Equine Pharmacology Research Laboratory (EPRL). ""There are always risks; these are high-speed sports. But we want to do everything we can to make sure there is no unneeded risk to the horse or to the jockey.""

Robinson directs the research lab, located on Penn Vet's New Bolton Center campus in Kennett Square, as well as the Pennsylvania Equine Toxicology and Research Laboratory (PETRL), which is located in West Chester and owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

The two labs work in tandem: PETRL is where the forensics work occurs, testing 35,000 blood and urine samples each year from horses competing at Pennsylvania's six race tracks. It is also where analytical chemists from Penn use cutting-edge science to develop new tests to ascertain whether a particular drug is present in a horse's system. At New Bolton Center's EPRL, researchers study the pharmacology of drugs to understand how the horse's body processes them and how they may affect performance outcomes.

Penn has been involved in developing new tests for equine doping since 1979, when Lawrence Soma, Robinson's predecessor, signed a contract with the racing commission to do so. Now Penn is directly connected to the work, with 28 Penn employees conducting research and evaluating samples.

As in every field of science, the drug tests used have evolved steadily in sophistication. Today, the gold standard is liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, or LC-MS, which physically separates different components of a sample and then analyzes them based on their particular masses.

""This process gives us a fingerprint of a substance that allows us to identify the specific peptides we're looking for,"" says Fuyu Guan, research associate professor of equine forensic chemistry.

The labs also use different forms of mass spectrometers to detect substances. The equipment is highly refined and expensive. A single LC-MS instrument costs roughly $500,000, and other pieces cost roughly half that. The lab has 14 of these systems, funding for which has been provided by the Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission, Pennsylvania Harness Horsemen's Association, and Meadows Standardbred Owners Association, among other sources.

One of the most significant advances the lab has achieved is erythropoietin (EPO) testing. Some might be familiar with EPO from news coverage of Lance Armstrong, but human recombinant EPO, which boosts the blood's ability to carry oxygen, has also been used in horse racing. It's challenging to detect, Guan notes, because, like humans, horses have a natural source of EPO, and human recombinant EPO is effective even at very low concentrations. In 2006, Penn Vet was the first lab to develop a test to detect recombinant EPO in horses, a test that is now used around the world.

""That was a really groundbreaking project,"" Robinson says, and one that won recognition and awards from numerous associations and attention from the World Anti-Doping Agency.

The work of anti-doping labs is often described to be in a kind of arms' race with dishonest athletes. That's because for every new drug coming into illicit use for performance-enhancing purposes, researchers have had to develop a new way of testing for its presence. Then the dopers begin developing ways of avoiding that detection.

That has been the case with substances such as cobalt, an essential mineral that, when given in large amounts, boosts red blood cell counts. Working with Penn Vet toxicologist Lisa Murphy, PETRL developed a test to identify a normal range for cobalt, prompting a new regulation to be adopted by the racing industry. Over the years, the lab has also worked to deter the use of anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, and other performance-enhancing substances, with sensitive and specific tests.

More recently, Guan and the PETRL team have developed yet another paradigm-shifting assay that allows them to step ahead of that arms' race, making life more complicated for would-be banned substance users.

Published last year in a top journal for analytical chemistry, the new screening method uses liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to extract and detect dozens of peptides--even those that are not yet characterized--from urine or blood samples. The acquired data can then be stored and accessed later if an animal is suspected of having been given a banned substance.

""The limitation of other methods is that they target only known peptides,"" says Robinson. ""This gives us a way to detect the unknown.""

As a proof-of-concept for this novel method, Guan found he was able to identify metabolites of dermorphin, a natural opioid extracted from the skin of South American frogs that acts as a powerful painkiller, even though the metabolites were not included on the list of drugs to be analyzed at the time of the initial screening.

""It's an amazing technology,"" says Guan. ""With this method, we can acquire data and later come back and do data mining to find unknown peptides. It's really a revolutionary way of doing things.""

Full complement

New Bolton's facilities enable scientists to translate the insights gleaned by chemists like Guan into an understanding of how to keep horses safe. Researchers make use of a specialized research barn, horse exerciser, and treadmill and perform precise pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to obtain information about how long after taking certain drugs an animal can safely and ethically return to competition.

""Even if a drug is given therapeutically, we need to know how long to wait after giving that drug until the horse can return to racing,"" Robinson says.

The lab's methods are becoming increasing refined. With funding from the racing commission, Penn Vet has created an ""exercised"" herd of horses that will be kept in top condition to more accurately reflect how fit horses respond to drugs.

Researchers are also embarking on studies that accurately measure a horse's VO2 max--a reflection of cardiovascular fitness--and developing ways to evaluate the performance-enhancing effects of things other than drugs, such as shockwave therapy.

Joanne Haughan, a research associate in the lab who coordinates the EPRL studies, says that, even though equine sports across the board are relatively ""clean,"" keeping up with testing helps keep them that way.

""Racehorses in Pennsylvania are all tested both in and out of competition,"" says Haughan. ""If you think about it, testing plays a huge role in prevention of the problem, as a deterrent to using banned substances.""

For that reason, PETRL doesn't share the full list of the drugs they're currently working on. But Robinson and others in the lab are constantly performing outreach, talking with trainers and with veterinarians around the state, the nation and the globe to stay ahead of would-be dopers.

""For me, animal welfare is the most important piece,"" Robinson says. ""We want to keep these animals and the jockeys and drivers safe.""

Source: University of Pennsylvania",9.0,0.45,2.0,0.1,Veterinary experts work to stay ahead of equine doping,"Elite athletes train for years to reach the top of their game. Yet some succumb to temptation, using performance-enhancing drugs to gain a slight edge over their competitors.

The same is true in equine sports. Though the vast majority of competitors come by their success honestly, some horses have been found with all manner of performance-enhancing drugs in their systems, used by unscrupulous trainers or veterinarians to give the animals an unfair advantage over the competition in races and sporting events. By masking the signs of overexertion or injury, such illicit drugs may set up a horse--and its rider--for harm, in addition to compromising the integrity of the sport.

At Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine, researchers and veterinarians work to maintain the welfare of horses involved in sports like racing, jumping, and eventing, while also helping ensure that participants in those events start on an even playing field.

""If horses are treated with something that is covering up an injury or building muscle or bone in an unnatural way, it can predispose them to an injury,"" says Mary Robinson, director of Penn Vet's Equine Pharmacology Research Laboratory (EPRL). ""There are always risks; these are high-speed sports. But we want to do everything we can to make sure there is no unneeded risk to the horse or to the jockey.""

Robinson directs the research lab, located on Penn Vet's New Bolton Center campus in Kennett Square, as well as the Pennsylvania Equine Toxicology and Research Laboratory (PETRL), which is located in West Chester and owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

The two labs work in tandem: PETRL is where the forensics work occurs, testing 35,000 blood and urine samples each year from horses competing at Pennsylvania's six race tracks. It is also where analytical chemists from Penn use cutting-edge science to develop new tests to ascertain whether a particular drug is present in a horse's system. At New Bolton Center's EPRL, researchers study the pharmacology of drugs to understand how the horse's body processes them and how they may affect performance outcomes.

Researchers from our Department of Psychology with colleagues at the University of Southampton used eye-tracking methods to investigate the causes of emotion recognition difficulties in teenagers with conduct disorder (CD). They hope their findings could pave the way for new treatments for children and young people with the condition.

Their findings, published in the prestigious Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, show that girls and boys with CD have difficulties in recognising emotional facial expressions compared to a control group of typically-developing children. These problems were particularly evident in boys with the condition and were seen for both static images and video-clips showing dynamic facial expressions.

'Are you looking at me?'

The researchers also studied the participants' eye movements while they were viewing the facial expressions, to see whether their emotion recognition problems were explained by abnormal eye movements. They found that girls and boys with CD were less likely to look at the eye region of the face - which is important because the eyes are so critical in terms of communicating how we are feeling. However, the researchers found that the abnormal eye movements seen in the girls and boys with CD did not fully explain the emotion recognition difficulties they display, suggesting that even when they do look at the right part of the face, they still find it more challenging to recognise the emotional expression.

Symptoms of CD range from lying and truancy, through to physical violence and weapon use at its more extreme end. It is thought that at least 5% of school-age children are affected, yet the condition is poorly understood and thought to be under-diagnosed and often untreated. It is different from more well-known behavioural conditions, like ADHD, although many children suffer from both disorders at the same time.

This new study suggests CD is linked to emotion recognition difficulties and abnormal eye movements in both boys and girls, which might have important implications for developing new psychological interventions for this condition. The fact that boys with CD showed more problems in recognising emotions and more atypical eye movements than girls suggests that boys with this condition might need more comprehensive and long-term interventions than girls.

Paving the way for new treatments

The senior author on the study from the University's Department of Psychology, Dr Graeme Fairchild, explains: ""We found that boys and girls with severe antisocial behaviour find it difficult to recognise negative facial expressions - particularly angry, disgusted, and fearful faces - and look less at the eye region of the face when trying to recognise facial expressions. These findings could lead to the development of new treatments aiming to enhance emotion recognition and empathy or even prevention programmes for at-risk children.""

Lead author, Dr Nayra Martin-Key, from the University of Southampton added: ""This is the first study to combine an emotion recognition task with eye-tracking methods to examine recognition of, and attention to, facial expressions in boys and girls with Conduct Disorder.

""We found that having Conduct Disorder and being male led to a 'double-hit' - the boys with Conduct Disorder found it hardest to recognise emotional faces and were least likely to look at the eyes of the faces, whereas the typically-developing girls were the best at emotion recognition and fixated most on the eye region of the face. This suggests that interventions designed to improve emotion recognition might need to be tailored according to gender, with boys with Conduct Disorder needing a longer or more comprehensive intervention than girls.""

The study involved 50 young people with CD and 51 typically-developing young people, all aged between 13-18 years.

Source: University of Bath",7.0,0.7,3.0,0.3,New study reveals emotion recognition difficulties in boys and girls with severe antisocial behaviour,"Teenage girls and boys with severe antisocial behaviour have difficulty recognising facial expressions and look less at important parts of the face, such as the eyes, according to a new study published on Friday 8 September 2017.

Researchers from our Department of Psychology with colleagues at the University of Southampton used eye-tracking methods to investigate the causes of emotion recognition difficulties in teenagers with conduct disorder (CD). They hope their findings could pave the way for new treatments for children and young people with the condition.

Their findings, published in the prestigious Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, show that girls and boys with CD have difficulties in recognising emotional facial expressions compared to a control group of typically-developing children. These problems were particularly evident in boys with the condition and were seen for both static images and video-clips showing dynamic facial expressions.

'Are you looking at me?'

The researchers also studied the participants' eye movements while they were viewing the facial expressions, to see whether their emotion recognition problems were explained by abnormal eye movements. They found that girls and boys with CD were less likely to look at the eye region of the face - which is important because the eyes are so critical in terms of communicating how we are feeling. However, the researchers found that the abnormal eye movements seen in the girls and boys with CD did not fully explain the emotion recognition difficulties they display, suggesting that even when they do look at the right part of the face, they still find it more challenging to recognise the emotional expression.

Symptoms of CD range from lying and truancy, through to physical violence and weapon use at its more extreme end. It is thought that at least 5% of school-age children are affected, yet the condition is poorly understood and thought to be under-diagnosed and often untreated. It is different from more well-known behavioural conditions, like ADHD, although many children suffer from both disorders at the same time.

This new study suggests CD is linked to emotion recognition difficulties and abnormal eye movements in both boys and girls, which might have important implications for developing new psychological interventions for this condition. The fact that boys with CD showed more problems in recognising emotions and more atypical eye movements than girls suggests that boys with this condition might need more comprehensive and long-term interventions than girls.

Paving the way for new treatments

The senior author on the study from the University's Department of Psychology, Dr Graeme Fairchild, explains: ""We found that boys and girls with severe antisocial behaviour find it difficult to recognise negative facial expressions - particularly angry, disgusted, and fearful faces - and look less at the eye region of the face when trying to recognise facial expressions. These findings could lead to the development of new treatments aiming to enhance emotion recognition and empathy or even prevention programmes for at-risk children.""

Lead author, Dr Nayra Martin-Key, from the University of Southampton added: ""This is the first study to combine an emotion recognition task with eye-tracking methods to examine recognition of, and attention to, facial expressions in boys and girls with Conduct Disorder.

""We found that having Conduct Disorder and being male led to a 'double-hit' - the boys with Conduct Disorder found it hardest to recognise emotional faces and were least likely to look at the eyes of the faces, whereas the typically-developing girls were the best at emotion recognition and fixated most on the eye region of the face.

An antibiotic-releasing nanofiber coating may prevent serious bacterial infections after knee or hip replacements, a preliminary study suggests.

The study was conducted on mouse knee joints, but the coating--if proven in further research--would have ""broad applicability"" not only for total joint replacements, but also for implants like pacemakers, stents, and other medical devices, researchers say.

The new material is designed to release multiple antibiotics in a strategically timed way for optimal effect.

""We can potentially coat any metallic implant that we put into patients, from prosthetic joints, rods, screws, and plates to pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and dental hardware,"" says co-senior author Lloyd S. Miller, associate professor of dermatology and orthopedic surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Surgeons and biomedical engineers have for years looked for better ways--including antibiotic coatings--to reduce infections after artificial hip, knee, and shoulder joint implants.

Every year, an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the more than 1 million hip and knee replacement surgeries done in the US are followed by infections linked to the formation of biofilms--layers of bacteria that adhere to a surface, forming a dense, impenetrable matrix of proteins, sugars, and DNA.

An acute infection immediately after surgery causes swelling and redness that often can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. But in some people, low-grade chronic infections can last for months, causing bone loss that leads to implant loosening and failure.

These infections are difficult to treat; in many cases, the prosthesis must be removed and the patient placed on a long course of antibiotics before a new one can be implanted. The cost to treat a biofilm-associated prosthesis infection often exceeds $100,000, Miller says.

Existing options for antibiotic delivery with an implant, such as antibiotic-loaded cement, beads, spacers, or powder, typically supply only one antibiotic at a time with a release rate that is not well-controlled. To develop a better approach, Miller teamed up with Hai-Quan Mao, professor of materials science and engineering at Johns Hopkins and a member of its Institute for NanoBioTechnology.

Infection eradicated

For three years, the team worked to design a thin biodegradable plastic coating that could release multiple antibiotics at desired rates. The coating is a nanofiber mesh embedded in a thin film; both components are made of polymers already approved for use in degradable sutures.

To test the technology, described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers loaded the nanofiber coating with the antibiotic rifampin in combination with one of three other antibiotics.

""Rifampin has excellent anti-biofilm activity but cannot be used alone because bacteria would rapidly develop resistance,"" Miller says. The coatings released rifampin over three to five days and the other drugs for seven to 14 days. ""We were able to deploy two antibiotics against potential infection while ensuring rifampin was never present as a single agent.""

Glowing bacteria

The team then used each combination to coat titanium Kirschner wires, a type of pin used in orthopedic surgery to fix bone in place after wrist fractures. They inserted the wires into the knee joints of anesthetized mice and introduced Staphylococcus aureus, bacteria that commonly cause biofilm-associated infections in orthopedic surgeries.

The bacteria were engineered to give off light, allowing the researchers to noninvasively track infection over time. After 14 days, mice who received pins without an antibiotic coating had abundant bacteria in infected tissue around the knee joint; 80 percent had bacteria on the surface of the implant. Mice that received coated pins had no detectable bacteria on the implants or in surrounding tissue.

""We were able to completely eradicate infection with this coating,"" Miller says. ""Most other approaches only decrease the number of bacteria but don't generally or reliably prevent infections.""

More research is needed to test the coating in humans and sort out which patients would benefit most. Support for the project came from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Medical Research.

Radiation therapy is one of three core modalities to treat cancer. Researchers found that radiation therapy targeted against a tumor can act as a ""cancer vaccine"" by causing neutrophil-mediated tumor cell death that alerts the immune system to fight the cancer cells at other anatomical sites.

The so-called ""abscopal effect,"" in which radiation therapy delivered to a primary site of cancer also results in shrinkage or elimination of cancer cells in non-irradiated metastatic sites has been observed for decades.

""The abscopal effect is only seen sporadically, but when it does happen, the effect induces a long-lasting, anti-tumor response in patients,"" said senior author Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""Our study in mice was designed to understand this phenomenon and identify strategies to enhance it.""

Findings from the study are reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America.

Researchers discovered what happens inside the tumor after radiation and how these events not only kill tumor cells but also lead to a whole-body anti-tumor response.

Study results show that neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cell in the body, are key players in the radiation-induced anti-tumor immune response. In the absence of radiotherapy, cancer cells transform neutrophils into tumor-associated neutrophils or TANs to help promote cancer cell growth. Radiation therapy, in addition to destroying TANs, recruits new neutrophils into the tumor. The radiation-induced neutrophils (RT-Ns) attack the tumor cells by producing molecules that damage them. The study further demonstrates how RT-Ns are also key players in generating a downstream tumor-specific, T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response.

""To our knowledge this is the first study to identify RT-Ns and to demonstrate their anti-tumor activity via both innate and adaptive immune responses,"" said Dr. Tsuguhide Takeshima, Instructor in Radiation Oncology and the lead author on the report.

Importantly, the researchers were able to discover a way to enhance the tumor killing capacity of the RT-Ns by administering G-CSF (Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), a naturally occurring protein (cytokine) in the body that stimulates bone marrow to produce more white blood cells including neutrophils. In the clinic, G-CSF is widely used to treat blood cell deficiencies in patients receiving chemotherapy. Researchers found that the combination of G-CSF and RT-Ns potentiated the anti-tumor immune response, presumably by inducing a more robust neutrophil response.

""We think these are exciting finding that should be easily translatable to the clinic since G-CSF is routinely used to treat neutropenia,"" said Dr. Ellen Vitetta, Professor of Immunology and Microbiology, and holder of The Scheryle Simmons Patigian Distinguished Chair in Cancer Immunobiology, and a coauthor on the publication.

""These results provide support for evaluating the combined use of radiation therapy and G-CSF in pre-clinical and clinical settings"" said Dr. Hannan. ""Our long-term goal is to eliminate the sporadic nature of the abscopal effect of radiation therapy and dependably induce the response every time.""

(Nanowerk News) Three-dimentional (3D) nanoporous graphene with preserved 2D Dirac electronic characters was successfully synthesized by Dr. Yoshikazu Ito and Prof. Mingwei CHEN at Advanced Institute for Materials Research (AIMR), Tohoku University. The nanoporous graphene is constructed by a single layer graphene sheet that is continuously inter-connected to form a complex 3D network structure. This free-standing nanoporous graphene with an excellent crystallinity possesses high mobility, holding great promise for the applications in electronic devices.

The nanoporous graphene were grown by a nanoporous metal based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as shown in Figure 1(a). The overall morphology of the nanoporous graphene in Figure 1(b) shows a ~20 um thick free-standing bulk sheet. Although the 3D nanoporous graphene has a complex structure, it is demonstrated to be 500 cm 2 /Vs in electron mobility and a mass-less Dirac cone system. As the conventional transistor requires electron mobility of 200 cm 2 /Vs, it is greatly expected that this nanoporous graphene will bring a new device which can be replaced with Si devices.

This work is collaborated with the research teams of Prof. Katsumi Tanigaki and Prof. Takashi Takahashi at AIMR, Tohoku University. This research results will be published in issue 19 of Angewandte Chemie International Edition as a Hot Paper on 2 May (""High-Quality Three-Dimensional Nanoporous Graphene"").

Graphene is a mono-layer carbon material with low cost, high chemical/thermal stability, and ultrahigh strength and is expected to be a replacement of silicon and noble metals for electron devices, battery materials, photo-/ion detectors and catalysts. Although some of graphene products such as display and electrodes are commercially available, the applications are limited due to the 2D sheet structure. In other words, the performance per gram is excellent but the performance per volume cannot be achieved easily. Therefore, many efforts have been made to construct the 2D material as a 3D structure with retained physical/chemical properties and high volumetric performance. However, the reported 3D nanoporous carbon materials suffer from poor mobility because of the lower crystallinity, which cannot be used for the electron devices. To achieve semiconductor-grade 3D carbon materials, the monolayer graphene sheet with a high crystalline structure is required in a 3D structure. Thus, we have developed a 3D nanoporous graphene with preserved high mobility and unique 2D electronic properties of graphene.

The nanoporous graphene in Figure 1 were synthesized by the nanoporous metal based CVD method. The nanoporous graphene fully inherits the geometric structure of the nanoporous nickel substrate after dissolving nickel. The atomic structure of the nanoporous graphene was observed by TEM as shown in Figure 2. The ligament in Figure 2(a) were constructed by flat surface parts (Figure 2(b)) and curvature parts (Figure 2(c)) of the graphene sheet. It is obvious that the six-membered rings were observed in the flat part while the five- and seven-membered rings were observed in the curved parts due to the geometrical requirement to create the curvature structures.

The physical properties of the nanoporous graphene were investigated. As the 2D graphene is a Dirac cone system (Figure 3(a)) and shows a linear dispersion electronic density of state (Figure 3(b)). The 3D nanoporous graphene in Figure 2 also demonstrates a linear relationship near the Fermi level, which is similar with the 2D graphene. The electron mobility of the nanoporous graphene with different pore sizes was measured. As the temperature increase, the electron mobility slightly decreases to 200-400 cm 2 /Vs. As compared with 2D CVD graphene, the electron mobility is still high enough for device applications.

(Nanowerk News) Three-dimentional (3D) nanoporous graphene with preserved 2D Dirac electronic characters was successfully synthesized by Dr. Yoshikazu Ito and Prof. Mingwei CHEN at Advanced Institute for Materials Research (AIMR), Tohoku University. The nanoporous graphene is constructed by a single layer graphene sheet that is continuously inter-connected to form a complex 3D network structure. This free-standing nanoporous graphene with an excellent crystallinity possesses high mobility, holding great promise for the applications in electronic devices.

The nanoporous graphene were grown by a nanoporous metal based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as shown in Figure 1(a). The overall morphology of the nanoporous graphene in Figure 1(b) shows a ~20 um thick free-standing bulk sheet. Although the 3D nanoporous graphene has a complex structure, it is demonstrated to be 500 cm 2 /Vs in electron mobility and a mass-less Dirac cone system. As the conventional transistor requires electron mobility of 200 cm 2 /Vs, it is greatly expected that this nanoporous graphene will bring a new device which can be replaced with Si devices.

This work is collaborated with the research teams of Prof. Katsumi Tanigaki and Prof. Takashi Takahashi at AIMR, Tohoku University. This research results will be published in issue 19 of Angewandte Chemie International Edition as a Hot Paper on 2 May (""High-Quality Three-Dimensional Nanoporous Graphene"").

Graphene is a mono-layer carbon material with low cost, high chemical/thermal stability, and ultrahigh strength and is expected to be a replacement of silicon and noble metals for electron devices, battery materials, photo-/ion detectors and catalysts. Although some of graphene products such as display and electrodes are commercially available, the applications are limited due to the 2D sheet structure. In other words, the performance per gram is excellent but the performance per volume cannot be achieved easily. Therefore, many efforts have been made to construct the 2D material as a 3D structure with retained physical/chemical properties and high volumetric performance. However, the reported 3D nanoporous carbon materials suffer from poor mobility because of the lower crystallinity, which cannot be used for the electron devices. To achieve semiconductor-grade 3D carbon materials, the monolayer graphene sheet with a high crystalline structure is required in a 3D structure. Thus, we have developed a 3D nanoporous graphene with preserved high mobility and unique 2D electronic properties of graphene.

""Academic medicine has been somewhat complacent in the face of the disruptive forces in health care, and as a result, the gap between the physician-leader workforce and the needs of our system has only widened,"" said J. Larry Jameson, MD, PhD, executive vice president of the University of Pennsylvania for the Health System and dean of Penn's Perelman School of Medicine. ""Health care systems need a new prescription to close this leadership gap.

Historically, physician leaders have been chosen based on their national prominence and excellence as master clinicians, star researchers, and revered educators. While these credentials remain important, they aren't sufficient in the current health care climate, the authors write.

Today's physicians practice in an era of changing payment models, rising costs, IT advances, and emerging technologies and therapies that are reshaping the delivery of patient care. Dynamic changes have also come with ongoing health system mergers and market consolidation. To lead effectively in this environment, doctors need not only sharp clinical expertise, but also opportunities to hone their communication, team building, and decision making skills, and gain knowledge of finance and business.

Jameson and co-author Caryn Lerman, PhD, vice dean for Strategic Initiatives and the John H. Glick, MD Professor in Cancer Research in the department of Psychiatry in the Perelman School of Medicine, suggest health systems focus on three strategies to create this new wave of leaders: rigorous mining of diverse talent pools to identify the most promising emerging physician leaders; building pipelines of future leaders with targeted leadership development to enable progressively increasing responsibility; and deliberate onboarding processes to integrate new leaders and assure alignment across missions and with the institutional culture.

Training in finance and business planning and personnel management should be central to professional development, as many physician leaders may manage budgets similar to those of medium-sized businesses, for example, and work in organizations which are among the largest employers in their community.

""Given the high rate of turnover among physician leaders, such as department chairs and deans, we can no longer afford to neglect the skills that are essential for leaders to succeed,"" they wrote. ""We believe there is a need for a new generation of leaders who can promote strategic and cultural alignment in the face of rapid change.""

At Penn, the Perelman School of Medicine has joined with the Wharton School to create an executive education program which will launch in 2019 for health care and academic medical leaders from across the nation and world. The program will provide targeted leadership development experiences and practical skills to enable today's and tomorrow's leaders of health systems and academic medical centers to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.

The new endeavor joins the Penn-Wharton MD/Master of Business Administration (MD/MBA) program, which is designed for medical students interested in integrating their medical course work with training in managerial, financial, and technical expertise in the health care field.

Another example is Penn Medicine's Healthcare Leadership for Quality Residency Track. This two-year training pathway for future physician leaders is one of only a few in the country to offer a pathway for residents aspiring to be leaders in health care quality, patient safety, or informatics. So far, more than one hundred residents have participated in the program.

To help meet the challenges of an increasingly complex landscape, the authors say, health systems should make leadership development an organizational priority - an emphasis which will also pay off in improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.

""The 21st century physician leader must be equipped with a new tool kit of skills for the leadership agility necessary for them to respond proactively to rapidly changing environments,"" Lerman said. ""Leadership development should be an organizational priority, preparing today's medical students and physicians to thrive in a continuously evolving era of health care.""

While these credentials remain important, they aren't sufficient in the current health care climate, the authors write.<br><br>Today's physicians practice in an era of changing payment models, rising costs, IT advances, and emerging technologies and therapies that are reshaping the delivery of patient care. Dynamic changes have also come with ongoing health system mergers and market consolidation. To lead effectively in this environment, doctors need not only sharp clinical expertise, but also opportunities to hone their communication, team building, and decision making skills, and gain knowledge of finance and business.<br><br>Jameson and co-author Caryn Lerman, PhD, vice dean for Strategic Initiatives and the John H. Glick, MD Professor in Cancer Research in the department of Psychiatry in the Perelman School of Medicine, suggest health systems focus on three strategies to create this new wave of leaders: rigorous mining of diverse talent pools to identify the most promising emerging physician leaders; building pipelines of future leaders with targeted leadership development to enable progressively increasing responsibility; and deliberate onboarding processes to integrate new leaders and assure alignment across missions and with the institutional culture.<br><br>Training in finance and business planning and personnel management should be central to professional development, as many physician leaders may manage budgets similar to those of medium-sized businesses, for example, and work in organizations which are among the largest employers in their community.<br><br>""Given the high rate of turnover among physician leaders, such as department chairs and deans, we can no longer afford to neglect the skills that are essential for leaders to succeed,"" they wrote. ""We believe there is a need for a new generation of leaders who can promote strategic and cultural alignment in the face of rapid change.""<br><br>At Penn, the Perelman School of Medicine has joined with the Wharton School to create an executive education program which will launch in 2019 for health care and academic medical leaders from across the nation and world. The program will provide targeted leadership development experiences and practical skills to enable today's and tomorrow's leaders of health systems and academic medical centers to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.<br><br>The new endeavor joins the Penn-Wharton MD/Master of Business Administration (MD/MBA) program, which is designed for medical students interested in integrating their medical course work with training in managerial, financial, and technical expertise in the health care field.<br><br>Another example is Penn Medicine's Healthcare Leadership for Quality Residency Track. This two-year training pathway for future physician leaders is one of only a few in the country to offer a pathway for residents aspiring to be leaders in health care quality, patient safety, or informatics. So far, more than one hundred residents have participated in the program.<br><br>To help meet the challenges of an increasingly complex landscape, the authors say, health systems should make leadership development an organizational priority - an emphasis which will also pay off in improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.<br><br>""The 21st century physician leader must be equipped with a new tool kit of skills for the leadership agility necessary for them to respond proactively to rapidly changing environments,"" Lerman said. ""Leadership development should be an organizational priority, preparing today's medical students and physicians to thrive in a continuously evolving era of health care.""<br><br>###<br><br>Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care. Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1765 as the nation's first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $7.8 billion enterprise.<br><br>The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top medical schools in the United States for more than 20 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools. The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $405 million awarded in the 2017 fiscal year.<br><br>The University of Pennsylvania Health System's patient care facilities include: The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center -- which are recognized as one of the nation's top ""Honor Roll"" hospitals by U.S. News & World Report -- Chester County Hospital; Lancaster General Health; Penn Medicine Princeton Health; Penn Wissahickon Hospice; and Pennsylvania Hospital -- the nation's first hospital, founded in 1751. Additional affiliated inpatient care facilities and services throughout the Philadelphia region include Good Shepherd Penn Partners, a partnership between Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network and Penn Medicine, and Princeton House Behavioral Health, a leading provider of highly skilled and compassionate behavioral healthcare.<br><br>Penn Medicine is committed to improving lives and health through a variety of community-based programs and activities.

A new study shows how dogs evolved in response to those changes, demonstrating that predators are sensitive to climate change because it alters the hunting opportunities in their habitat.

Old dogs can teach humans new things about evolution. In Nature Communications a new study of North American dog fossils as old as 40 million years suggests that the evolutionary path of whole groups of predators can be a direct consequence of climate change.

""It's reinforcing the idea that predators may be as directly sensitive to climate and habitat as herbivores,"" said Christine Janis, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University, who worked with lead author Borja Figueirido, a former Brown Fulbright postdoctoral researcher who is now a professor at the Universidad de Malaga in Spain. ""Although this seems logical, it hadn't been demonstrated before.""

The climate in North America's heartland back around 40 million years ago was warm and wooded. Dogs are native to North America. The species of the time, fossils show, were small animals that would have looked more like mongooses than any dogs alive today and were well-adapted to that habitat. Their forelimbs were not specialized for running, retaining the flexibility to grapple with whatever meal unwittingly walked by.

But beginning just a few million years later, the global climate began cooling considerably and in North America the Rocky Mountains had reached a threshold of growth that made the continental interior much drier. The forests slowly gave way to open grasslands.

Pups of the plains

Did this transition affect the evolution of carnivores? To find out, Figueirido and the research team, including Jack Tseng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, examined the elbows and teeth of 32 species of dogs spanning the period from ca. 40 million years ago to 2 million years ago. They saw clear patterns in those bones at the museum: At the same time that climate change was opening up the vegetation, dogs were evolving from ambushers to pursuit-pounce predators like modern coyotes or foxes -- and ultimately to those dogged, follow-a-caribou-for-a-whole-day pursuers like wolves in the high latitudes.

""The elbow is a really good proxy for what carnivores are doing with their forelimbs, which tells their entire locomotion repertoire,"" Janis said.

The telltale change in those elbows has to do with the structure of the base where the humerus articulates with the forearm, changing from one where the front paws could swivel (palms can be inward or down) for grabbing and wrestling prey to one with an always downward-facing structure specialized for endurance running. Modern cats still rely on ambush rather than the chase (cheetahs are the exception) and have the forelimbs to match, Janis said, but canines signed up for lengthier pursuits.

In addition, the dogs' teeth trended toward greater durability, Figueirido's team found, consistent perhaps with the need to chow down on prey that had been rolled around in the grit of the savannah, rather than a damp, leafy forest floor.

Not an 'arms race' of limbs

The study, with some of Janis' prior research, suggests that predators do not merely evolve as an ""arms race"" response to their prey. They don't develop forelimbs for speedy running just because the deer and the antelope run faster. While the herbivores of this time were evolving longer legs, the predator evolution evident in this study tracked in time directly with the climate-related changes to habitat rather than to the anatomy of their prey species.

After all, it wasn't advantageous to operate as a pursuit-and-pounce predator until there was room to run.

""There's no point in doing a dash and a pounce in a forest,"" Janis quipped. ""They'll smack into a tree.""

If predators evolved with climate change over the last 40 million years, the authors argue, then they likely will have to continue in response to the human-created climate change underway now. The new results could help predict the effects we are setting in motion.

""Now we're looking into the future at anthropogenic changes,"" Janis said.

Dec. 9, 2013 -- Curiosity had its head in the clouds for the past couple of months, so to speak. Its first scientific reports focused on what was left of Mars' atmosphere, including the lack of any methane there.

But Curiosity's research team is now turning its focus back on the ground, narrowing its search toward where exactly to find organic material that may have supported life on the red planet.

NASA's latest findings are spread across six different papers published in the online edition of the journal Science. In addition to thoroughly analyzing the data that led to the claim earlier this year that Mars could have harbored life once upon a time, the papers also address the chemical and geological clues that may guide where Curiosity travels next to hunt for organic material.

The hunt has been a difficult one on account of the high level of radiation on Mars' surface. ""The radiation has so much energy that it breaks apart the chemical bonds,"" said Jennifer Eigenbrode, who co-presented Curiosity's most recent findings today at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting. ""It forms radicals and reacts with anything they can as quickly as they can. Understanding the chemistry is important to hypothesize what the story could have been [on Mars].""

Paul Mahaffy, a research scientist at NASA, said that because of that radiation, it's important to find patches of Martian land that were only recently exposed to the surface. ""We need to look for a site that was recently eroded, like the site exposed by a fresh crater,"" he told ABC News. ""If we were to find an area exposed for only 1 million years, we'd be happy, since there's a much better chance of preserving the original organic material.""

And finding those sites may be easier thanks to knowing the geology of Mars as well. The new research suggests that Curiosity should look near the bases of downwind scarps, a specific type of cliff. By combining the radiation data with geological data, Mahaffy said that there's a better idea of where to hunt for organic material. ""We need to drive close to a scarp that's been exposed for about 1 million years,"" said John Grotzinger, project scientist for Curiosity that also presented the new research. ""We only need a few centimeters.""

Mahaffy added that while it's good to officially confirm what NASA hypothesized several months ago about Mars' potential to harbor life, there's more to the picture. ""We kind of knew that already,"" he said of the likelihood that there was life of Mars. Instead, he sees the real draw as confirming that radioactive dating methods that are commonly used on Earth work on another planet.

""Our measurements provide crucial information for human missions to Mars,"" said Dr. Don Hassler, a Southwest Research Institute program director and RAD principal investigator. Hassler is the lead author of ""Mars' Surface Radiation Environment Measured with the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rover,"" scheduled for publication in the journal Science online on December 9, 2013. ""We're continuing to monitor the radiation environment, and seeing the effects of major solar storms on the surface and at different times in the solar cycle will give additional important data. Our measurements also tie into Curiosity's investigations about habitability. The radiation sources that are of concern for human health also affect microbial survival as well as the preservation of organic chemicals.""

Two forms of radiation pose potential health risks to astronauts: a chronic low dose of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and the possibility of short-term exposures to the solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The radiation on Mars is much harsher than on Earth for two reasons: Mars lacks a global magnetic field and the Martian atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, providing little shielding to the surface.

This environmental factor poses a challenge for future human exploration of Mars and is also important in understanding both geological and potential biological evolution on Mars. Both GCRs and SEPs interact with the atmosphere and, if energetic enough, penetrate into the Martian soil, or regolith, where they produce secondary particles that contribute to the complex radiation environment on the Martian surface, which is unlike anything on Earth.

""The RAD surface radiation data show an average GCR dose equivalent rate of 0.67 millisieverts per day from August 2012 to June 2013 on the Martian surface,"" said Hassler. Radiation dose is measured in units of sievert (Sv) or millisievert (1/1000 Sv). ""In comparison, RAD data show an average GCR dose equivalent rate of 1.8 millisieverts per day on the journey to Mars, when RAD measured the radiation inside the spaceship.""

According to RAD data, most mission radiation exposure will be during outbound and return travel, when the astronauts will be exposed to the radiation environment in interplanetary space, shielded only by the spacecraft itself. The total during just the transit phases of a Mars mission would be approximately 0.66 Sv for a round trip with current propulsion systems and during similar solar activity. A 500-day mission on the surface would bring the total exposure to around 1 Sv.

Long-term population studies have shown that exposure to radiation increases a person's lifetime cancer risk; exposure to a dose of 1 Sv is associated with a five percent increase in fatal cancer risk. Although NASA has generally established a three percent increased risk of fatal cancer as an acceptable career limit for astronauts in low earth orbit, it does not currently have a limit for deep space missions, and is working with the National Academies Institute of Medicine to determine appropriate limits for deep space missions, such as a mission to Mars in the 2030s.

SwRI, together with Christian Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany, built RAD with funding from the NASA Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate and Germany's national aerospace research center, Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt.

Hassler is the lead author of ""Mars' Surface Radiation Environment Measured with the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rover,"" scheduled for publication in the journal Science online on December 9, 2013. ""We're continuing to monitor the radiation environment, and seeing the effects of major solar storms on the surface and at different times in the solar cycle will give additional important data. Our measurements also tie into Curiosity's investigations about habitability. The radiation sources that are of concern for human health also affect microbial survival as well as the preservation of organic chemicals.""

Two forms of radiation pose potential health risks to astronauts: a chronic low dose of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and the possibility of short-term exposures to the solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The radiation on Mars is much harsher than on Earth for two reasons: Mars lacks a global magnetic field and the Martian atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, providing little shielding to the surface.

This environmental factor poses a challenge for future human exploration of Mars and is also important in understanding both geological and potential biological evolution on Mars. Both GCRs and SEPs interact with the atmosphere and, if energetic enough, penetrate into the Martian soil, or regolith, where they produce secondary particles that contribute to the complex radiation environment on the Martian surface, which is unlike anything on Earth.

""The RAD surface radiation data show an average GCR dose equivalent rate of 0.67 millisieverts per day from August 2012 to June 2013 on the Martian surface,"" said Hassler. Radiation dose is measured in units of sievert (Sv) or millisievert (1/1000 Sv). ""In comparison, RAD data show an average GCR dose equivalent rate of 1.8 millisieverts per day on the journey to Mars, when RAD measured the radiation inside the spaceship.""

According to RAD data, most mission radiation exposure will be during outbound and return travel, when the astronauts will be exposed to the radiation environment in interplanetary space, shielded only by the spacecraft itself. The total during just the transit phases of a Mars mission would be approximately 0.66 Sv for a round trip with current propulsion systems and during similar solar activity. A 500-day mission on the surface would bring the total exposure to around 1 Sv.

Long-term population studies have shown that exposure to radiation increases a person's lifetime cancer risk; exposure to a dose of 1 Sv is associated with a five percent increase in fatal cancer risk. Although NASA has generally established a three percent increased risk of fatal cancer as an acceptable career limit for astronauts in low earth orbit, it does not currently have a limit for deep space missions, and is working with the National Academies Institute of Medicine to determine appropriate limits for deep space missions, such as a mission to Mars in the 2030s.

It has done that, and now a spate of new findings is driving the mission in a new direction: searching for traces of ancient life. Leaders of the 400-strong Curiosity science team say their latest discoveries, published online today in Science, are narrowing down how and where to look for ""molecular fossils""--organic matter that might have come from ancient martian microbes.

""Our mission is turning a corner,"" says Curiosity project scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. ""We are beginning to map a way forward, a way to explore deliberately for organic matter.""

Curiosity's new analyses of sediment from the bed of a long-vanished lake hint that Mars harbors substantial amounts of organic matter of some sort, although no one is yet willing to attribute it to ancient life. And in a martian first, Curiosity has determined how recently surface rocks have been exposed by erosion. That opens the way to more systematic searches for molecular fossils, by showing scientists how to maximize their chances of finding organic matter that was only recently exposed to the ravaging rain of cosmic rays that pours down on Mars.

The last time Curiosity scientists reported on the hunt for organic matter, things were a bit of a mess. Perchlorate compounds--powerful oxidizers when heated--turned out to be ubiquitous on Mars. And because Curiosity's onboard test for organic matter involves heating finely powdered rock by hundreds of degrees, any organic carbon compounds would be oxidized to carbon dioxide before the carbon's original form could be determined. A few molecules did survive, but they seemed to come from a contaminant that leaks into Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package.

SAM team members now report that their contamination problem is behind them. The contamination ""can't explain it all,"" says SAM team member Daniel Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. By analyzing empty sample containers, varying the amount of sample, and flushing out samples before analysis, the SAM team has concluded that the contaminant now accounts for only 1% to 3% of the carbon appearing as carbon dioxide.

The remaining 97% may well have come from martian organic matter. The SAM authors reached that conclusion after Curiosity took its first look beneath the planet's surface. At a site called Yellowknife Bay, which has a rock outcrop that seems to have been the bottom mud of an ancient lake, the probe drilled 5 centimeters into the rock. The team then compared samples of windblown dust scooped off the surface with samples of rock powder from the borehole. The dust had been exposed to organics-destroying solar ultraviolet, cosmic rays, and radiation-activated perchlorates for many millions of years. The lakebed had long been shielded by encasing rock.

When SAM heated the samples, the lakebed samples emitted more carbon dioxide than equal-size dust samples did, and their carbon dioxide came off at lower temperatures. Those observations suggested that heating the dust had simply decomposed naturally occurring, inorganic carbonate minerals, but that heating the lakebed samples had burned organic matter. Most telling, as carbon dioxide from the lakebed surged, the level of oxygen gas from decomposing perchlorates dropped. On seeing those data, one SAM team member reportedly declared, ""This is combustion of organic carbon, folks.""

Curiosity's Glavin says the results are ""exciting,"" but he and the rest of the SAM team are more cautious in print. So is organic geochemist Mark Sephton of Imperial College London, who is not on the Curiosity team. The results are ""very consistent with organic carbon,"" he says, but he adds that so far they are ""tantalizing"" rather than definitive.

Tempering the excitement is Glavin's ready admission that ""we can't say anything about the origin of this [organic] carbon."" That's because a nonbiological source is close at hand: Tons of organic matter fall on Mars every year in meteorites and cosmic dust. Researchers estimate that these organic compounds, made not by living things but by chemical processes in space, could have supplied Mars's surface with between about 10 parts per million (ppm) and several hundred ppm of carbon--enough at the high end to account for all of the roughly 500 ppm of carbon that Curiosity has detected in the lakebed samples.

What's more, the ancient environment around Gale crater does not appear to have been very hospitable to life, new analyses reported in the Science papers suggest. The lakebed deposits--which washed into the crater from surrounding high ground--show ""very little evidence for chemical weathering"" before arriving in the lake, says team member Scott McLennan of Stony Brook University in New York. That suggests that there was little liquid water around to alter the minerals and thus that ""we're dealing with very arid and/or cold environments,"" McLennan says. The area may have resembled the hostile, hyperarid Atacama Desert of Chile, where water flows only during rare torrential rainstorms.

The muddy lake bottom might have been more hospitable. In their paper, Grotzinger and his Curiosity colleagues describe the bottom mud there as a ""strikingly Earth-like habitable environment."" But to survive in the mud of an oxygen-free planet, any microbes would have had to derive energy from the chemical imbalances between minerals in the sediment--""eating rock"" in a process called chemolithotrophy.

On Earth, ""fully convincing"" chemolithotrophy is known only in kilometers-deep rock exposed in South African gold mines, according to marine geochemist Steven D'Hondt of the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett. And levels of organic carbon there are minuscule compared with the 500 ppm of carbon reported on Mars. So if the martian carbon is indeed organic, the best guess now is that either Curiosity has stumbled across the remains of an unexpected subsurface oasis, or most of the carbon comes from meteorites.

Another of the recent results may make it easier to search for martian carbon--and ultimately sort out its origins. For the moment, carbon-hunters face a serious obstacle: Cosmic rays penetrate the rock down a meter or so, far beyond the reach of Curiosity's drill, and over millions of years utterly destroy any organic matter.

In one paper, Kenneth Farley of Caltech and colleagues demonstrate an elegant solution: a way to identify rock that has been buried for eons beneath at least a couple meters of protective rock and only recently exposed by wind erosion. Using SAM's mass spectrometer, they measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays generate as they pass through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. Using the technique, they show that the 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago as winds sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. An ideal drill site would be tens of millions of years fresher, but it's a start.

""It gives us a rational way to look for organics on Mars,"" Grotzinger says. So next time, Curiosity's handlers will just look for a sign of recent wind erosion, such as a step up in the rock, nuzzle the rover up to the step, and see just how freshly exposed the rock is.

Perchlorate compounds--powerful oxidizers when heated--turned out to be ubiquitous on Mars. And because Curiosity's onboard test for organic matter involves heating finely powdered rock by hundreds of degrees, any organic carbon compounds would be oxidized to carbon dioxide before the carbon's original form could be determined. A few molecules did survive, but they seemed to come from a contaminant that leaks into Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package.<br><br>SAM team members now report that their contamination problem is behind them. The contamination ""can't explain it all,"" says SAM team member Daniel Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. By analyzing empty sample containers, varying the amount of sample, and flushing out samples before analysis, the SAM team has concluded that the contaminant now accounts for only 1% to 3% of the carbon appearing as carbon dioxide.<br><br>The remaining 97% may well have come from martian organic matter. The SAM authors reached that conclusion after Curiosity took its first look beneath the planet's surface. At a site called Yellowknife Bay, which has a rock outcrop that seems to have been the bottom mud of an ancient lake, the probe drilled 5 centimeters into the rock. The team then compared samples of windblown dust scooped off the surface with samples of rock powder from the borehole. The dust had been exposed to organics-destroying solar ultraviolet, cosmic rays, and radiation-activated perchlorates for many millions of years. The lakebed had long been shielded by encasing rock.<br><br>When SAM heated the samples, the lakebed samples emitted more carbon dioxide than equal-size dust samples did, and their carbon dioxide came off at lower temperatures. Those observations suggested that heating the dust had simply decomposed naturally occurring, inorganic carbonate minerals, but that heating the lakebed samples had burned organic matter. Most telling, as carbon dioxide from the lakebed surged, the level of oxygen gas from decomposing perchlorates dropped. On seeing those data, one SAM team member reportedly declared, ""This is combustion of organic carbon, folks.""<br><br>Curiosity's Glavin says the results are ""exciting,"" but he and the rest of the SAM team are more cautious in print. So is organic geochemist Mark Sephton of Imperial College London, who is not on the Curiosity team. The results are ""very consistent with organic carbon,"" he says, but he adds that so far they are ""tantalizing"" rather than definitive.<br><br>Tempering the excitement is Glavin's ready admission that ""we can't say anything about the origin of this [organic] carbon."" That's because a nonbiological source is close at hand: Tons of organic matter fall on Mars every year in meteorites and cosmic dust. Researchers estimate that these organic compounds, made not by living things but by chemical processes in space, could have supplied Mars's surface with between about 10 parts per million (ppm) and several hundred ppm of carbon--enough at the high end to account for all of the roughly 500 ppm of carbon that Curiosity has detected in the lakebed samples.<br><br>What's more, the ancient environment around Gale crater does not appear to have been very hospitable to life, new analyses reported in the Science papers suggest. The lakebed deposits--which washed into the crater from surrounding high ground--show ""very little evidence for chemical weathering"" before arriving in the lake, says team member Scott McLennan of Stony Brook University in New York. That suggests that there was little liquid water around to alter the minerals and thus that ""we're dealing with very arid and/or cold environments,"" McLennan says. The area may have resembled the hostile, hyperarid Atacama Desert of Chile, where water flows only during rare torrential rainstorms.<br><br>The muddy lake bottom might have been more hospitable. In their paper, Grotzinger and his Curiosity colleagues describe the bottom mud there as a ""strikingly Earth-like habitable environment."" But to survive in the mud of an oxygen-free planet, any microbes would have had to derive energy from the chemical imbalances between minerals in the sediment--""eating rock"" in a process called chemolithotrophy.<br><br>On Earth, ""fully convincing"" chemolithotrophy is known only in kilometers-deep rock exposed in South African gold mines, according to marine geochemist Steven D'Hondt of the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett. And levels of organic carbon there are minuscule compared with the 500 ppm of carbon reported on Mars. So if the martian carbon is indeed organic, the best guess now is that either Curiosity has stumbled across the remains of an unexpected subsurface oasis, or most of the carbon comes from meteorites.<br><br>Another of the recent results may make it easier to search for martian carbon--and ultimately sort out its origins. For the moment, carbon-hunters face a serious obstacle: Cosmic rays penetrate the rock down a meter or so, far beyond the reach of Curiosity's drill, and over millions of years utterly destroy any organic matter.<br><br>In one paper, Kenneth Farley of Caltech and colleagues demonstrate an elegant solution: a way to identify rock that has been buried for eons beneath at least a couple meters of protective rock and only recently exposed by wind erosion. Using SAM's mass spectrometer, they measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays generate as they pass through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. Using the technique, they show that the 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago as winds sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. An ideal drill site would be tens of millions of years fresher, but it's a start.<br><br>""It gives us a rational way to look for organics on Mars,"" Grotzinger says. So next time, Curiosity's handlers will just look for a sign of recent wind erosion, such as a step up in the rock, nuzzle the rover up to the step, and see just how freshly exposed the rock is. Voila: a whole new approach to prospecting for past life on the Red Planet. </div>"

Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz uses computer ",0.3,1,"New study shows what happens during the destruction of a star as it falls into a black hole, contradicting a 2012 report of the disruption of an exotic helium star.

Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz uses computer simulations to explore the universe's most violent events, so when the first detailed observations of a star being ripped apart by a black hole were reported in 2012 (Gezari et al., Nature), he was eager to compare the data with his simulations. He was also highly skeptical of one of the published conclusions: that the disrupted star was a rare helium star.

""I was sure it was a normal hydrogen star and we were just not understanding what's going on,"" said Ramirez-Ruiz, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In a paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal and available online atarXiv.org, Ramirez-Ruiz and his students explain what happens during the disruption of a normal sun-like star by a supermassive black hole, and they show why observers might fail to see evidence of the hydrogen in the star. First author and UCSC graduate student James Guillochon (now an Einstein Fellow at Harvard University) and undergraduate Haik Manukian worked with Ramirez-Ruiz to run a series of detailed computer simulations of encounters between stars and black holes.

Supermassive black holes are thought to lurk at the centers of most galaxies. Some (known as active galactic nuclei) are very bright, emitting intense radiation from superheated gas falling into the black hole. But the central black holes of most galaxies in the local universe have run out of gas and are quiescent. Only when an unlucky star approaches too close and gets shredded by the black hole's powerful tidal forces does the galactic center emit a bright flare of light. Astronomers call this a ""tidal disruption event"" (TDE), and in a typical galaxy it happens about once every 10,000 years.

""That means you have to survey the nearest 10,000 galaxies in order to see one event, so for many years this was very much a theoretical field,"" Ramirez-Ruiz said.

Then came Pan-STARRS(Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System), which is surveying the sky on a continual basis and has begun detecting and recording observations of these very rare events. The first one, known as PS1-10jh, was detected in 2010 and published in 2012. Astronomers recorded the light curve (the rise and fall in brightness over time) and took a spectrum at peak brightness to study the different wavelengths of light.

Something missing

The spectrum of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) shows characteristic ""emission lines"" at specific wavelengths corresponding to the most common elements such as hydrogen and helium. These emission lines appear as spikes of increased intensity in a continuous spectrum. The shocking thing about PS1-10jh was the absence of a hydrogen line in the spectrum.

""It's very unusual to have seen helium and not hydrogen. Stars are mainly made of hydrogen, and stars made only of helium are extremely rare, so this was a huge issue,"" Guillochon said. ""People said maybe it was a giant star with a helium core and a hydrogen envelope, and the black hole removed the hydrogen first and then the helium core in a second pass.""

Guillochon began to explore the possibilities using computer simulations. The results provide a new understanding of the origin of the emission lines in a tidal disruption event. They show that the flare of light from a tidal disruption contains information about the type of star and the size of the black hole. And they show that PS1-10jh involved the most common type of star (a main-sequence star much like our sun) and a relatively small supermassive black hole.

When a star gets disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces first stretch the star into an elongated blob before shredding it. In a full disruption, about half of the star's mass gets ejected and the other half remains bound in elliptical trajectories, eventually forming an ""accretion disk"" of material spiraling into the black hole.

Previously, researchers had thought that the unbound material formed a wide ""fan,"" and that this fan of ejected material was the main source of emission lines. But in Guillochon's simulations, the unbound material is confined by self-gravity into a narrow band that doesn't have enough surface area to be the source of the emission lines. Instead, the emission lines must come from the accretion disk. The simulations show how this disk forms over time, starting with the inner part and growing outward.

Birth of an AGN

According to Ramirez-Ruiz, it is like watching the birth of an active galactic nucleus. The emission lines in a TDE correspond to the well-studied ""broad line region"" of AGNs. In an AGN, the emission lines of different elements are produced at different distances from the central black hole. Helium lines are produced deep in, while hydrogen lines are produced farther out where the intensity of ionizing radiation is slightly lower. When the spectrum of PS1-10jh was taken, the accretion disk simply had not grown big enough to reach the distance where hydrogen starts to produce an emission line.

""The hydrogen is there, you just don't see it because it is so highly ionized. The way to understand the spectrum of a TDE is to think of it as an AGN with a truncated disk, because the disk is still growing,"" Guillochon said. ""In an AGN, the emission is steady because the disk is established. In our model of tidal disruption, you are seeing the broad line region being built.""

More recently, another TDE was detected (PS1-11af), and its spectrum had neither hydrogen nor helium emission lines. ""Our model tells us that this would have to be a smaller black hole, and when the spectrum was taken the disk was so small you would not expect to see either hydrogen or helium,"" Guillochon said.

The new paper also shows how the light curve of a TDE can yield information about the masses of both the star and the black hole. The light curves derived from the simulations match the observed light curves remarkably well. ""With this simple model, we get a perfect fit to the data, and we're able to explain the light curve in multiple color bands,"" Ramirez-Ruiz said. ""The type of star and the size of the black hole are imprinted in the light curve.""

According to Ramirez-Ruiz, Pan-STARRS is expected to detect dozens of tidal disruptions, and the planned Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could detect thousands per year. This means that astronomers will be able to study quiescent black holes at the centers of local galaxies that would otherwise be difficult if not impossible to detect. If it is not emitting light, a supermassive black hole reveals its presence only through its effects on the motions of stars, and the smaller the black hole, the harder it is to see those effects.

""We are now detecting black holes that are very close to the detection limit,"" Ramirez-Ruiz said. ""Tidal disruption is elucidating a local population of low-mass quiescent black holes, and it is going to enable us to test the idea that every galaxy has a black hole at its center, even the tiny ones.""

Stars are mainly made of hydrogen, and stars made only of helium are extremely rare, so this was a huge issue,"" Guillochon said. ""People said maybe it was a giant star with a helium core and a hydrogen envelope, and the black hole removed the hydrogen first and then the helium core in a second pass.""<br><br>Guillochon began to explore the possibilities using computer simulations. The results provide a new understanding of the origin of the emission lines in a tidal disruption event. They show that the flare of light from a tidal disruption contains information about the type of star and the size of the black hole. And they show that PS1-10jh involved the most common type of star (a main-sequence star much like our sun) and a relatively small supermassive black hole.<br><br>When a star gets disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces first stretch the star into an elongated blob before shredding it. In a full disruption, about half of the star's mass gets ejected and the other half remains bound in elliptical trajectories, eventually forming an ""accretion disk"" of material spiraling into the black hole.<br><br>Previously, researchers had thought that the unbound material formed a wide ""fan,"" and that this fan of ejected material was the main source of emission lines. But in Guillochon's simulations, the unbound material is confined by self-gravity into a narrow band that doesn't have enough surface area to be the source of the emission lines. Instead, the emission lines must come from the accretion disk. The simulations show how this disk forms over time, starting with the inner part and growing outward.<br><br>Birth of an AGN<br><br>According to Ramirez-Ruiz, it is like watching the birth of an active galactic nucleus. The emission lines in a TDE correspond to the well-studied ""broad line region"" of AGNs. In an AGN, the emission lines of different elements are produced at different distances from the central black hole. Helium lines are produced deep in, while hydrogen lines are produced farther out where the intensity of ionizing radiation is slightly lower. When the spectrum of PS1-10jh was taken, the accretion disk simply had not grown big enough to reach the distance where hydrogen starts to produce an emission line.<br><br>""The hydrogen is there, you just don't see it because it is so highly ionized. The way to understand the spectrum of a TDE is to think of it as an AGN with a truncated disk, because the disk is still growing,"" Guillochon said. ""In an AGN, the emission is steady because the disk is established. In our model of tidal disruption, you are seeing the broad line region being built.""<br><br>More recently, another TDE was detected (PS1-11af), and its spectrum had neither hydrogen nor helium emission lines. ""Our model tells us that this would have to be a smaller black hole, and when the spectrum was taken the disk was so small you would not expect to see either hydrogen or helium,"" Guillochon said.<br><br>The new paper also shows how the light curve of a TDE can yield information about the masses of both the star and the black hole. The light curves derived from the simulations match the observed light curves remarkably well. ""With this simple model, we get a perfect fit to the data, and we're able to explain the light curve in multiple color bands,"" Ramirez-Ruiz said. ""The type of star and the size of the black hole are imprinted in the light curve.""<br><br>According to Ramirez-Ruiz, Pan-STARRS is expected to detect dozens of tidal disruptions, and the planned Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could detect thousands per year. This means that astronomers will be able to study quiescent black holes at the centers of local galaxies that would otherwise be difficult if not impossible to detect. If it is not emitting light, a supermassive black hole reveals its presence only through its effects on the motions of stars, and the smaller the black hole, the harder it is to see those effects.<br><br>""We are now detecting black holes that are very close to the detection limit,"" Ramirez-Ruiz said. ""Tidal disruption is elucidating a local population of low-mass quiescent black holes, and it is going to enable us to test the idea that every galaxy has a black hole at its center, even the tiny ones.""<br><br>This research was supported by the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and NASA.

A passing star wanders too close and gets caught in the black hole's gravitational pull, like a fly trapped in a spider's web. The star then becomes an easy meal for the black hole, which tears its prey to bits and ingests a good portion of it.

Astronomers have witnessed several such disruptions before in distant galaxies, but usually only toward the end of the process. (These feedings are far too rare, however, to have been witnessed in our own Milky Way anytime in recent human history; they occur only once every 10,000 years or so per galaxy.) Now researchers have documented a black hole's feasting in such detail that they were able to infer its size as well as the type of star that fell prey to its gluttony.

Astronomers cannot peer inside a black hole itself; beyond the event horizon, a black hole's point of no return, even light cannot escape into the outside world. But material falling into a black hole gives off intense flares of radiation as it compresses and heats up outside the event horizon.

Suvi Gezari, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, and her colleagues used a number of different telescopes to track the outburst from a supermassive black hole in a galaxy more than two billion light-years away as the black hole consumed a star that ventured too close.

""While there has been evidence of these types of flares before, there's never been enough information to say what kind of star fell victim to the black hole, and what was the mass of the black hole that destroyed the star,"" Gezari says. She and her colleagues published their findings online May 2 in Nature. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.)

They first discovered the flare using the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii, a relatively new observatory that can scan the sky rapidly and repeatedly to identify changes in a celestial object's appearance. In May 2010 the telescope picked up a transient feature in the sky, dubbed PS1-10jh, that brightened rapidly in visible light. Around the same time, NASA's spaceborne Galaxy Evolution Explorer registered a flare in the ultraviolet at the same location, near the center of an otherwise unremarkable galaxy. Both telescopes followed PS1-10jh into 2011 as it peaked and finally faded; the researchers also commandeered the larger MMT telescope in Arizona to take spectroscopic readings of the flaring object.

""Because we [saw] the flare of radiation at so many different wavelengths and in so much detail over time,"" Gezari explains, the researchers were able to closely compare their observations with theoretical predictions for a star's infall into a black hole. The match between observation and theory is quite convincing, says Giuseppe Lodato, an astrophysicist at the University of Milan who wrote a commentary accompanying the research in Nature. ""The shape of the light curve is very close to what is expected for such events--it's actually one of the best examples,"" he says.

And with the help of the spectra from MMT, which can pinpoint individual chemical species by the wavelength of light they emit, Gezari and her colleagues were able to parse the makeup of the debris from the disrupted star. That material is notably bereft of hydrogen, the most common element in the universe. ""We see no evidence of hydrogen in the system,"" she says. ""This is very peculiar gas. It's mostly helium gas.""

The composition of the stellar debris indicates that the devoured star was the helium-rich core of a red giant--a swollen type of star that the sun will evolve into some five billion years from now. ""When [a red giant] balloons up, its hydrogen envelope is very vulnerable to being stripped by the gravitational forces of the black hole,"" Gezari says. ""What we're seeing is this sort of stripped core.""

The tracking of the flaring black hole over more than a year, with multiple telescopes, allowed for an unprecedented level of forensic reconstruction, Lodato notes. ""This is the first time that such accurate determination of the star's properties have been done,"" he says.

It also allowed the researchers to draw some conclusions about the black hole and how much of the star it ultimately consumed. Gezari and her colleagues estimated, based on the properties of the flare and the physical attributes of red-giant cores, that the black hole has a mass of roughly three million suns. (The Milky Way's central supermassive black hole, for comparison, is about four million solar masses.) And by summing up the radiated light from the flaring black hole, the researchers concluded that possibly 10 percent, and perhaps as much as half, of the star ended up being consumed. ""A large fraction of the star gets ejected away,"" Gezari says. ""It's a very messy process.""",4.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,Big Gulp: Flaring Galaxy Marks the Messy Demise of a Star in a Supermassive Black Hole,"Once in a while, a supermassive black hole gets a sumptuous treat.
